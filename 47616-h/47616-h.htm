<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p class='unindent'><span class="smcap">This</span> book was suggested by the questions of
a boy of twelve who lived in Germany and sent
for an English book that would teach him the
elements of gardening. One of the authors
asked the editor of a well-known gardening
journal to recommend her a suitable book, and
found that he knew of none written from a
child’s point of view, and supplying the instruction
a child could understand and use. Yet in
these days, when so many children have a garden,
such a book must be needed. The aim in this
one has been to tell the juvenile reader how to
make his garden grow, and the authors have not
allowed themselves to wander in the pleasant
byways of description, reflection, or amusement.
They wished to help the budding gardener rather
than to entertain the child, and they have tried
to keep within the limits of what a child can do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>But as children vary in age and strength as
well as in circumstances, they will not all be able
to follow the whole of the advice here given.
Cyril, for instance, could dig his own little plot
of ground, but Betty could not for many a year
to come; and though Cyril may not have the
patience to sow his sweet peas in the best of all
possible ways, Betty will read in this book how
it should be done, and then get one of her father’s
gardeners to do it for her. As for Barbara, she
is a traveller, and can have no garden of her own;
but she sets daffodils in her friends’ gardens, and
is content to see them, with her inward eye,
dancing in the breeze for their delight. So all
children, according to their strength and means,
may love a garden, whether it is contained in a
few flower-pots on a city window-sill, or encouraged
to expand and grow in the wide spaces
of the country.</p>

<p>Gardening, like other bents, will find a way;
but it will run more smoothly if it has a little
help at the beginning.</p>

<h2>THE CHILDREN’S BOOK OF
GARDENING</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>THE SITUATION AND SOIL</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> first thing to decide is that you really want
a garden of your own, and mean to work in it and
keep it clean and tidy. The next thing is to
learn a little about situation and soil, because
you cannot choose which plants to grow until
you know what conditions you can give them.
You must not think that you can ram any plants
into any patch of ground with success. There
are a few that are obliging and will live almost
anywhere, but even these will generally show
you by their size and health whether they like
their home or not. Many will just exist, but not
do well without the food or place that suits them,
while others will die unless they have what they
want.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>If you can possibly avoid it, do not have your
garden under trees or large shrubs, or close to an
evergreen hedge. The drip from trees is bad for
nearly all plants, and the big roots made by
trees and shrubs exhaust the soil. Besides,
on account of the roots, you cannot dig the
ground properly and feed it with manure. However,
if your choice is between a shady garden
and none, you should certainly take it, and
learn what can be done with it. Later on in the
book we will tell you which plants will do well
in such a spot, and how you should treat them.
The best situation for a garden is one that gets
the morning sun, and is either right out in the
open or sheltered on the north. It is best for
the plants and best for you, because in a warm,
sunny corner you can often work on days when
it would not be safe in the chilly parts of the
garden.</p>

<p>Do not have a large plot if you mean to look
after it without help: twelve feet long by seven
feet wide would be enough, and even a smaller
piece could be made into a pretty garden. If
you have more than you can keep tidy, the
grown-ups will be sorry they let you have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
garden at all, and some day they will say that
the gardener wants your bit of sunny border for
his winter lettuces, and that you had better take
yourself and your weeds and your mess away to
that no-man’s-land in the shrubbery, where
nothing much will grow, and where it is always
sad and chilly. So we will imagine that your
garden is twelve feet long and seven feet wide,
and that the sun shines on it whenever it is fine.</p>

<p>Whether your plot is a bed by itself or part of
a wide border, it will not be easy and pleasant to
manage unless you make a path through the
centre—a dry, hard, narrow path, on which you
can stand or kneel when you are at work amongst
your plants. Across the breadth would be the
most convenient position. To do this you should
get a penny piece of tape, because it is easier to
see and keep straight than string. Measure the
length of your garden with it, having tied one
end of the tape to a stick and put the stick
firmly into one corner of the ground. Tie a knot
in the tape when you reach the other corner.
Then carry the knot back to the stick, and the
doubled tape will mark the centre of the whole
length. Put a stick into the ground there. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
you get two other sticks, and put them nine inches
on either side of the centre one, so as to get your
eighteen-inch path exactly measured at the top of
your garden. The other side of the garden may be
measured in the same way, and the centre sticks
removed at either end. Then you bring your
tape right along both sides of your path, tying
it to your sticks at each end, so that you have
two straight lines to guide you. If you are going
to make your path yourself, you must now take
your spade and dig out all the earth to the depth
of ten inches. This will be hard work, and take
you several days, but if you want your path to
be dry and firm it must be done. The earth
you throw out should be divided as evenly as
possible between your two beds, and be neatly
spread on them when you have finished. The
deep trench you make by digging must be filled
with broken stones or pieces of brick well stamped
down, and afterwards covered with gravel or fine
stones. Now you will have two borders, each
seven feet long and five feet three inches wide. If
you choose you can make one side a flower garden
and the other side a kitchen garden, and in your
kitchen garden you can grow some flowers as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
well as vegetables. In any case, you will be
glad of your path, and if your plot is smaller than
the one we recommend, you should make it on one
side instead of in the middle. As far as possible,
you should do all your gardening from it, so that
the soil around the plants does not get trodden
down too hard. Most plants like to have a firm
hold with their roots, but not to have a caked
surface that keeps out the air and rain.</p>

<p>Before you put in any plants you must pay
some attention to the state of your soil. Even
grown-ups often seem to think that earth is earth,
and that any flowers will nourish in any ground.
But, as a matter of fact, plants are even more
various and dainty about their food than human
beings; they answer as well to clever treatment,
and they look as starved as slum children when
they are not properly fed. Gardeners usually
tell you that nearly everything will nourish in a
good loam, and that it may be either natural or
the result of cultivation. Soil of this kind is a
mixture of clay, sand, and humus, and is easily
worked. In or near London you generally get
abominable soil in your garden, because the
builders have dug out the good stuff and replaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
it with any kind of rubbish. Everyone knows
the London mixture of black, sticky clay, broken
bricks and bottles, and the roots of grimy trees
and shrubs. Many things will no more thrive in
such a medium than a baby would on lobster
salad. If you have to begin your gardening
career with a builder’s rubbish-heap, you must
be content to grow some of the strongest
things, such as Starworts, Foxgloves, Nasturtiums,
and some bulbs, and to renew them every
year.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, soils may be divided into
heavy and light—those that hold wet and those
that do not. The heavy kinds are mostly clay,
though pure peat retains a great deal of moisture.
The light soils are gravel, limestone, and sand.
If you are used to a heavy clay soil, you will
envy the people who have a light sandy one; and
then some day when you come to work a hungry,
sandy garden, you will wish for some of the
sticky soil that is not easy to handle, but which
many plants love. In either case you must try
to improve matters, and to do this you must first
find out what your soil is. In a limestone country
you need not add lime, but it would be good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
for clay. In Holland pure sand has been made
fertile by the addition of cow manure.</p>

<p>It is often said that the gardener’s year begins in
November, because that is when you would make
a new bed, or feed and alter an old one. If you
make a bed well one autumn and grow things
that like to be left alone, you would obviously
not make it all over again the next. You would
‘mulch’ any part of it that required food or protection—<i>i.e.</i>,
you would supply a top dressing, a
winter blanket of manure that would both keep
things warm, and, with the help of the air and rain,
send them food. When the spring comes, these
top dressings look untidy, and they are either
lightly and carefully forked in or taken away.
By that time they are chiefly straw. When you
are making a new bed, or reorganizing an old one
completely, you cover the soil three inches thick
with manure, make trenches, and take care that
it is all buried at least ten inches deep, because
very few plants like to come into contact with it
when it is first put into the ground. It is an
operation that you cannot manage at all for yourself
if you are a girl. You must get a gardener
or an elder brother to do it for you. If you tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
digging in manure, your nurse would say to you
what the nurse in Leech’s old picture said to the
child who stirred her tea with the snuffers: ‘Miss
Mary, you are not to stir your tea with the
snuffers. It is not at all ladylike, and I am sure
your papa would not approve of it.’</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 476px;">
<img src="images/i_023.jpg" width="476" height="600" alt="child cleaning up garden path" />
<div class="caption">THE TIDY GARDENER.</div>
</div>

<p>The manure used should not be quite fresh, or
it will make the earth ‘sick,’ as gardeners say,
and kill your delicate plants and seedlings. After
it has been dug in, the winter frosts and rains do
a great deal to ripen it, and in the spring, when
you plant, your flowers will be vigorous and plentiful,
because they will find the food they need
ready for them. But if you live in a town you
may not be able to get farm manure easily, and
then you would find a chemical one useful.
Clay’s Fertilizer is a well-known manure, and so is
Shefa, but many people have killed their plants
by using too much of them. A tablespoonful to
the square yard is enough, and it should be
scattered evenly over the surface before it is dug
in. There are many other chemical manures,
but it is not necessary for you to know much
about them yet. If your grown-ups understand
them, they will provide you with what your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
soil needs; and if they do not, you can get on
very well with the manures described here. Do
not use chemical manures if you have a damp,
heavy soil. In any garden it is a good plan to
collect all the rubbish you can—old rags and toys,
for instance, dry dead leaves, and small dry sticks—for
a bonfire. The ashes left provide a food that
all plants like, and they should never be wasted,
but dug into the soil. In the country soot is
good for your soil, and most useful in keeping off
slugs. In a town you would not use it at all
except as a defence against slugs. Leaf-mould
is good for all soils, but it is not a rich food.
Sand should be mixed with clay land that is
heavy and sticky. Lime is valuable where soil
is ‘sour,’ dark, and mossy, and some plants need
it, as a child needs milk; but you had better not
try to apply it by yourself. It has to be ‘slaked’
by the air or with water before it is used, and
makes a white powdery dust that would not be
liked on your clothes. Mortar from buildings
contains lime, and is easier to manage.</p>

<p>If you cannot enlist a gardener, and are going
to make your own garden, you must learn to dig
it over properly, and for this you will want a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
strong spade suited to your height. You begin
by digging a trench ten inches deep from one end
of your garden to the other. The earth you take
out should be put in a wheelbarrow or on the
farther side of the border. When the first trench
is finished you put some manure all along it;
then you start a second one, close to the first, and
this time you put the earth you take out into the
manured trench ready for it. In this way the
manure and the soil that was on the top get
buried beneath soil that has been hidden till now
from the light and air. You go on making these
trenches side by side until you reach the edge of
the border, and you fill the last one with the soil
you first removed, which is waiting for you in the
wheelbarrow. In digging you should put your
spade straight down into the ground, and help it
with your foot to go in deep; then lean back
on it, lift it out full of soil, and tilt it sharply
into the empty trench. But you should not try to
dig with a full-sized spade, as even with a small
one you will find it hard work. The operation
is a most important one, because when the buried
soil is brought to the top the weather comes and
gardens for you there, as well as deeper down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
where the manure now lies covered. The winter
frosts, the summer rains, the air and the sunlight,
all affect it strongly, sweeten it, break it, and make
it ready for your flowers. In the winter the surface
of your beds should be left as rough as possible,
because then the frost can get in easily and do
its work. We will tell you later several ways of
protecting some of your plants from frost, for the
degree of cold that improves your soil will kill
your favourite plants if you do not take care of
them. But if you become a really keen gardener,
you will find that you often look at the weather
from the gardener’s point of view. The rainy
day that is disappointing other people will be
settling in the newly-planted things, or helping
your seeds to germinate, or persuading your
bulbs to put out roots. When warm weather
comes, you know that everything will take a start,
and get on quickly; but the frosty days that
skaters love will make you anxious, especially
while you are a beginner. When you have had
a garden for a year or two, you will have seen
many a plant hang its head for a time and after
all recover.</p>

<p>The tools used by your elders will be too large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and heavy for you, but on no account have a
‘Child’s Garden Set,’ as they are never strong.
Buy each implement separately, of good quality,
and the size to suit you. You will want a spade,
a hoe, a rake, a broad flat trowel, and a small
hand-fork. If possible, you should also have a
two-quart watering-can, a sieve, and a little galvanized
iron or wooden wheelbarrow for rubbish.
Always knock the earth off your tools when you
have done gardening, scrape them clean, and put
them away in a dry shed. They should never be
left out in the wet. The watering-can should be
emptied and turned upside down to dry. If you
cannot have a wheelbarrow of your own, you
must use an old pail or basket for weeds and
rubbish. These should be carefully collected as
you work, and then either thrown away or saved
in a neat heap for your bonfire. Weeds are
sometimes burnt, sometimes buried deep under
the soil to make ‘humus,’ and sometimes left
on a rubbish-heap until they have decayed and
are ready to make soil again. ‘Humus’ is
the dark earthy substance that you get from
decayed vegetation, and it is useful to plants;
but in your little plot you will not have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
large quantity of weeds, and when you have
planted it you will not want to dig holes to bury
them. You will see many operations going on
in the large garden that you cannot imitate and
need not understand until you have learned to
cultivate your own. When that time comes,
and you know all that we can teach you, there
are many larger, fuller books that will tell you a
great deal we must leave untold. We shall only
discuss things that you can grow without much
skill, or strength, or expense. A little sense and
patience, and a little of your pocket-money, will
enable you to carry out our instructions.</p>

<p>But we do not mean that you can grow all the
plants we talk about in one summer. We have
chosen a few from thousands, and from those few
you must choose again, according to your taste
and your conditions. All the beautiful annuals
and perennials we speak of will grow in any
country garden that has sun part of the day, and
we will tell you which do best in towns. But it
is most important not to grow more things than
you have room for or time to tend. There is no
pleasure in a crowded, badly-grown annual, for
instance, that is mean and stunted, because twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
plants are struggling for life where one would
just flourish comfortably. You must consider
well what you want to grow and what you can
grow, both in your flower and your vegetable
garden. You must find out what size the plants
will be, what colour, and when they will flower.
It is no use to say to yourself that a scarlet autumn
Gladiolus would look well next to a white Foxglove;
you must remember that the Foxglove
flowers in June and the Gladiolus in August.
You must be careful not to put orange and
magenta next to each other; but, on the whole,
we should advise you not to trouble much about
colour yet. Out-of-doors flowers harmonize in
unexpected ways. You should consider the height
of your plants, and put the tall ones at the back
of your border. There are some exceptions to this
rule, but we will leave you to study those in any
well-kept gardens you are lucky enough to see.
As long as your garden is a child’s garden you had
better put your dwarf plants in front and your
tall ones behind. But you must find out which
plants will like your climate and your soil, and
which you have room for comfortably. If you
have a tiny plot, do not choose anything that will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
make a big bush. Some lovely plants are quite
small, so that you could grow a good many in a
garden two feet square.</p>

<p>We have not said anything yet about the
edging of your garden, because you are quite
likely to find that ready-made. Tiles have the
merit of keeping clean and tidy; a Box edging is
pretty, but it has to be clipped neatly, and it
affords shelter to snails and slugs. Turf requires
much attention, and wears bare easily. The best
edging is one of rough stones laid well into the
soil, and with soil worked into the spaces between
them. In case you have not seen these edgings,
and yet can get some stones, we had better
explain that each stone should be wedged as firmly
as possible into the ground, but not covered; then
in the pockets of earth between the stones you
plant all kinds of tiny creeping plants, and these
soon make a charming border. We will give you
the names and habits of some in the chapter on
rockeries. Do not, at any rate, have an absurd
border of little pebbles, as they get out of place
at once, and look untidy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>ANNUALS</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">By</span> annuals we here mean flowers that bloom in
summer from seed sown in early spring. Out of
a long list we shall choose twelve that are all easy
to grow and last in flower a long time. From
these twelve you must choose again, for there
would not be room for many in a small plot, and
if you crowd them none will do well. It is a
great mistake to think that people who can grow
nothing else successfully can manage annuals.
All the good seedsmen know how often they
are blamed for failures when the amateur, or
even the professional gardener, should blame
himself. He has sown on ill-prepared soil, or
too deeply; he has let birds eat the seed, or
slugs and snails the seedlings; or he has sown
too much seed, and been too lazy to thin out
properly. Small birds are dreadful thieves in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
some gardens, and if you find them in yours you
should put little twigs where you have sown your
seed, and stretch a maze of black cotton from one
twig to the other. They soon get to know that
the cotton is there and keep away.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 471px;">
<img src="images/i_034.jpg" width="471" height="600" alt="girl feeding birds in garden in winter" />
<div class="caption">JANUARY.</div>
</div>

<p>The twelve annuals we have chosen for you
are:</p>


<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Sweet-peas.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Mignonette.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Clarkia.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Malope.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Godetia.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Larkspur (<i>Delphinium</i>).</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Love-in-a-mist (<i>Nigella</i>).</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Nasturtiums.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Sunflowers.</li>
<li>10. Shirley Poppies.</li>
<li>11. Alonsoas.</li>
<li>12. Eschscholtzia.</li></ul>

<p>For most seeds that are sown in the open
ground you must wait till the end of March in
the South of England, and till the first or second
week of April in the North. The old saying
that ‘a peck of March dust is worth a King’s
ransom’ will teach you something about sowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
seeds. It means that you want your soil to be
in a workable state, not hard with frost or
sloppy with heavy rains, but friable and just
moist with a light spring shower. When these
pleasant spring days come, your work in the
garden begins in earnest, and so does your
pleasure. Some of the bulbs you have planted
in autumn will be flowering; others will be pushing
their way up towards the light; and your
herbaceous plants—those that died down in the
autumn—will be coming up again, and making
delicious young green leaves. The part of your
garden that you have saved for annuals must be
carefully hoed and raked now, so that all the
weeds are destroyed, and the soil made fine and
powdery for your seedlings. Their little roots
could not strike down and get any hold in hard,
big lumps of earth, and it would be a waste
of money and time to sow seed there. You
should remove all stones and weeds, and break
up the lumps of earth with your rake. The
surface of your seed-bed, when ready, should
be quite smooth and fine. If the seed to be
sown is small, mix it with double its own quantity
of sand, or dry sifted earth, as that helps you not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to sow too thickly. Do not choose a windy day
if you can help it, or your seeds would blow away.
For a big patch of seeds it is best to take your
hoe and draw shallow trenches, one inch deep and
twelve or fifteen inches apart. When these are
ready, take the seed in your hands and carefully
dribble it in as evenly as you can. When you
have finished, rake the earth smoothly over the
trenches again, and pat it gently in place. You
should always put a stick or a label where you
sow seed or set bulbs, as it is easy to forget what
one has done, and put things on the top of each
other.</p>

<p>In favourable weather some of your seedlings
will show their seed-leaves in ten days or a fortnight,
but others will take longer. The first
pair of leaves are what botanists call cotyledons,
and those that come after are unlike them. You
will soon get to know both the cotyledons and
the other leaves of the plants you grow. You
can often tell your seedlings from weeds by
observing a whole colony of new-comers exactly
alike, where you have placed a stick or a label.
As soon as you can handle them they will
want carefully thinning, and when you find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
out how troublesome it is to thin a patch of
Poppies properly, for instance, you will understand
why we advise you to mix all your small
seed with sand, and only to put a pinch into the
ground. Firms that sell penny packets of seed
tell you that there are two thousand seeds in some
of their packets. Poppy seeds nearly all come
up, and a well-grown plant should have a foot of
soil to itself. So if you made a hedge of poppies
all along one side of your border, you would use
seven seeds out of two thousand. All gardeners
sow more seeds than they mean to use, because
they must allow for accidents and insects, and they
expect to do some thinning. But the ignorant
gardener invariably sows his seed too thick, and
leaves his seedlings too close together; so he
gets a crowd of starved, stunted plants that do
not flower well, and are soon over for the year.
You should begin by leaving three inches between
your seedlings, and end by giving most of them
a foot apiece. Some will require more room,
some rather less, and the best way to please them
is to watch them constantly, and make sure that
each little plant has room to expand. In thinning
seedlings you must be most careful not to disturb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the roots of those you wish to leave, and when
you have sown too thickly this is difficult. Some
seedlings will bear pricking out in another part
of the garden; some, such as Wallflowers, actually
like it; while others will not stand it at all. You
should do your pricking out in showery weather.</p>

<p>Pricking out means taking up all your seedlings
and planting them in rows to grow bigger. We
will tell you as we go on which flowers should be
raised in this way. Seed that is to be pricked
out is usually sown in a box or a shallow earthenware
pan with holes in it, or in the ground under
a bell-glass. Any grocer will give or sell you
an empty soap or sweetmeat box that will do for
seeds. It should have one or two holes bored in
the bottom, and a few potsherds or bits of broken
brick for drainage. The soil should be sifted and
moist. A bell-glass is a dome of glass with a knob
at the top, and should be about twelve inches
across and ten inches high. You can get one for
eighteenpence at a china-shop, and you will find
it useful if you have neither a frame nor a greenhouse.
You may put it on half-hardy plants at
night to keep the frost from them, or on newly-sown
seeds to hurry them on. In very cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
weather you would leave it on plants all day, but
slip a bit of wood under one side to let air in for
an hour or two at noon. When you use it for
seed, you do not move it until the seedlings
appear. You should not prick out your seedlings
until they have made four leaves besides the
cotyledons. When you grow seed in pans or
boxes, you do not thin out the seedlings, so they
will probably be close together. If they are dry
you should begin by watering them with a fine
rose; then take your hand-fork, put it in close
to the plants you wish to remove, dig it well
down, lift gently, and a whole group of plants will
come up with a lump of earth.</p>

<p>Break the seedlings gently apart, each singly.
Great care must be taken not to bruise the plants
or tear the tender roots. When you have
separated about a dozen, plant them out, and as
you do this consider how much space will be
required for each. Snapdragons and Marigolds
should be a foot apart, but Lettuces can do with
nine inches, and Violas with rather less. Sometimes
seedlings are pricked out into neat beds in a
reserve part of the garden, and transplanted later
to the borders where they are to flower. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
they are put out at once into their permanent
situation. This is partly a question of
habit and partly of room. When a plant is not
going to flower till next year, you would rather
keep it out of your show border this year, so if
you have a nursery border you let it grow up
there. If it is going to flower in a few weeks,
you may as well give it a good place at once and
leave it alone. Then, again, some things are the
better for the check of transplantation, while
others recover with difficulty or not at all. In
gardening it is easier to make general rules for
the gardener than for his plants. He must be as
wise as a good doctor, and find out what treatment
different plants require, what food, what surgery
or medicine, and what stimulants; and he must
even learn, just as a doctor must, to apply his
general knowledge to his special case. For
instance, the very Geranium that he has taken
into his greenhouse every winter in Yorkshire
may be planted against the south wall of his
house if he lives in Cornwall, and trusted in a
few years’ time to reach the roof, and give him
flowers for his Christmas dinner-table. All that
he knows about gardening must be influenced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and sometimes considerably altered, by his own
local conditions of soil, aspect, and climate. You
must remember this when you buy your seeds in
the spring and your bulbs in the autumn, and
choose those that do well in your neighbourhood.
You should always observe what plants other
people near you are growing in their gardens,
and what conditions they give them. In that
way you can learn a great deal about the
management of your own.</p>


<p class='center'><span class="smcap">Sweet-Peas.</span></p>

<p class='poem'>
‘Here are sweet-peas on tiptoe for a flight,<br />
With wings of gentle flush o’er delicate white,<br />
And taper fingers catching at all things,<br />
To bind them all about with tiny rings.’<br />
</p>

<p>We like to remind you of these charming lines
by Keats, because then you will always think of
them when you look at your own Sweet-peas on
a summer day. But our business is to tell you
how to grow them, so that they are ready for the
poet when he comes by, and we do not begin
with a summer day, but with one at the end of
winter, when the seed lists come and set you
thinking of spring. Sweet-peas have become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
such a popular flower of late years that we have
heard people talk of the ‘Sweet-pea world,’ by
which we suppose they meant the growers who
cultivate the many new varieties and the rare
shades. When you are grown up you will have
to decide for yourself whether you belong to any
of these ‘worlds’ in the florist’s sense of the
word. We have never had the least desire to
grow a black Tulip or a blue Rose, but there is no
doubt that when ‘fanciers’ take up a flower they
improve it for a time. If you gave up gardening
for ten or twelve years, and then began again,
you would find that there were new varieties of
some of your old favourites, and that the sorts
you used to grow were not admired now. The
most popular and well-known flowers all have
such a history. Your grandmother would remember
when every Dahlia in the garden was as
stiff as the modern little Pom-poms, but much
bigger. Then, about twenty-five years ago, the
single Dahlias ousted the stiff ones, and now we all
grow Cactus Dahlias, with long pointed, twisted
petals. So with Sweet-peas. Fifty years ago no
one wanted anything but a mixed clump, some
of which would be mauve or purple, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
marbled, and some pink. Now it is usual to
grow each colour by itself, and every year we
seem to get better colours and bigger flowers.
The fanciers of the ‘Sweet-pea world’ have taken
Sweet-peas in hand, and by careful cultivation
and selection have given us many new and beautiful
varieties. At first novelties are dear, because
the stock of seed is small, but for a few pence
you can have a hedge that would have rejoiced
Keats; and if you are a wise child, you will certainly
grow those that have become plentiful.
We will give you the names of some varieties
that we like best, but you will easily understand
from the little we have told you that some years
hence our list will probably look old-fashioned.
Even to-day anyone you happen to know in the
‘Sweet-pea world’ might make a different choice.
The names we give you are the names of the
Sweet-peas we like and have grown with success.</p>


<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. King Edward VII. (vivid red).</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Gorgeous (orange-salmon).</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Blanch Burpee (white).</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Navy Blue (violet-blue).</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Lady Grizel Hamilton (mauve).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Mrs. Collier (yellow).</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Lovely (pale pink).</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Miss Willmott (salmon-pink).</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Black Knight (maroon).</li>
<li>10. Countess Spencer (wavy pink).</li>
<li>11. Nora Unwin (frilled white).</li>
<li>12. Gladys Unwin (pale pink).</li></ul>



<p>Sweet-peas grow very tall if they are healthy
and properly staked, so they should be sown all
along the back of your border to make a hedge.
If you buy a packet of some expensive variety
that gives you only a few seeds, you might sow
those separately in a circle.</p>

<p>The best month for sowing is March, and you
must dig your trench six inches deep and three
inches wide. If there are many mice about who
would eat your seeds, it is a good plan to soak
them in paraffin a few minutes before sowing.
Gardeners often damp them and shake them in
powdered red lead, but as this is poison it must be
used with care. It is not always effectual, either.
We once saw a mouse caught ‘red-handed,’ his
little paws coated with the lead we had put on
our seed to protect it from him. When your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
trench is ready, sow your seed singly all along the
row, leaving two inches between each seed. If
your two borders are each seven feet long, you
would sow forty-two seeds on either side, so you
see that you can only grow a few kinds in one
summer. When you have sown them, do not
cover them with all the soil you have dug out.
They should only have three inches on them at
first, because the seedling wants to find its way
up to the spring sun. Later on, when it is a
strong plant, and supported by a twig, you can
put back the rest of the soil. Sweet-peas are
very thirsty plants, and when the long dry days
come they like to have their roots deep down in
the moist earth.</p>

<p>Their two great enemies are slugs and sparrows.
In or near a town where sparrows swarm, you
cannot grow Sweet-peas at all unless you protect
the young shoots when they first show above the
ground—about three weeks, that is, after the seed
is sown. Later, when the leaves expand, the
birds leave the plants alone. You can buy either
ready-made pea-guards or a length of wire-netting,
which should be doubled in the middle and put
over your row like a long tent, with sticks at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
either end to keep it firm. If you cannot have
wire put a double line of sticks at intervals along
your row, and wind black cotton across and across
from one stick to the other. This terrifies the
sparrows, and they will not go near it. If you
have many slugs, you should keep the ground
near the seeds sprinkled with soot or lime. As
soon as the plants are three inches high, they
should be thinned to six inches apart, and should
have a row of small twigs stuck all along the line
for their tendrils to seize. When they are a foot
high, you can earth them up with the soil left on
one side of the trench, but you must put it evenly
on either side of your Peas. When they reach
the top of the little twigs, the tall ones must be
put in firmly on either side of the row, and by
the middle or end of June your Peas should be in
flower. If you want your plants to last in flower
all the summer and well into the autumn, you
must not let them form a single seed-pod. Every
day you should cut both your fresh flowers and
any withered ones you see. In dry, hot weather
they should be well watered at the roots from a
can without a rose. Give each plant a soak of
water <i>at the roots</i>, and do not trouble about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
leaves. We emphasize this advice because Sweet-peas
after they are six inches high suffer easily
from drought, and we know that many children
think they have given a plant a drink if they
spray its upper leaves with a fine rose. You
might as well give a thirsty baby a drink by
splashing its face.</p>

<p>To grow Sweet-peas in a clump, take out the
earth from a circular patch that you can mark
with a garden sieve or a big flower-pot. Sow
from eight to a dozen seeds, and thin to four
plants when you feel safe from slugs and sparrows.
Treat them just as you do those grown in a
hedge, but when you put in your tall stakes make
them all slant a little towards the centre, so that
they meet at the top. The Hazel branches that
you get easily in many neighbourhoods are best
for Sweet-peas. Where these are scarce, you
must use what you can find. The wire hurdles
recommended for garden Peas where stakes are
scarce would answer, but they are expensive and
ugly. If your garden is not airy and sunny, it is
a waste of time and money to try Sweet-peas.
They are impatient of shade, of starved soil, or of
a crowded garden. If they come up at all in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
such conditions, they will never do well, and will
most probably be devoured by green fly.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mignonette.</span></h3>

<p>You are sure to want some Mignonette in your
garden, because it is so fragrant; but in choosing
a place for it you must remember that it will not
make a splash of gay colour in the border. It
grows from ten to twelve inches high; but, as
you do not tie it up, it should be sown in front of
plants whose stalks are not really longer, but which
require a stake. It likes a good loam, but it will
grow in almost any soil if it gets enough sun.
Do not give it fresh manure, or it will run to leaf.
It is one of the few annuals that should be sown
in firm, hard ground. We do not mean ground
that is hard because it is poor and neglected, but
well dug soil that you tread or press down to
make it ready for your seed. When you have
done this, you sprinkle the seed thinly, cover
it with half an inch of fine earth, and pat that down
firmly with your hands or your trowel. You should
choose a fine April day for your first sowing, and
you should reserve a little seed for a second
sowing in case the first is a failure. This sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
happens even when your seed comes from
a good firm and you sow it properly. It is a
great mistake to buy poor Mignonette seed, as
often none of it comes up. In ten days or a
fortnight a soft spring rain will bring up the little
plants, and then, if you have sown too thickly,
you will find out how troublesome it is to thin
them; but you will not have fine Mignonette
unless you do this ruthlessly. Crowded plants
will give you stunted flowers. The best way
is to fix your eye on a seedling that is outgrowing
its brothers, and remove all that are near it, taking
great care not to disturb or loosen the one you
wish to keep. You should watch your Mignonette
and thin it out several times, so that each plant
has room to breathe and grow. Six inches at
least should in the end be left between the plants,
and then you will only have left half the distance
recommended by many good gardeners. So you
see what a tiny pinch of seed would give you all
the plants you need. Mignonette must be sown
where it is to bloom, as it has a tap-root, and will
not stand transplanting.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Clarkia.</span></h3>

<p>This annual comes to us from California, and
is very pretty and easy to grow. But it likes
a good soil. On a dry, starved one we have seen
it so poor that we hardly knew it was Clarkia,
and yet these miserable dwarfed specimens came
from the same packet of seed that had grown into
a bed of lovely pink and salmon-pink sprays
two feet high in another part of the garden. If
your border has been well prepared and is sunny,
your Clarkia seed is sure to do well in it. You
can sow it either in a large patch or in little drills
or trenches ten inches apart, and it should be
covered with one inch of fine soil. The centre
of the bed would be a good place for it. Sow in
April, and thin out the small plants to six inches
between each. There are a good many varieties.
We recommend Salmon Queen and Carnation
Flaked Pink.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Malope.</span></h3>

<p>This annual, if well grown, is about two feet
high, and should be in the centre of your border.
It has large red, white, or pink trumpet-shaped
flowers that bloom at intervals amongst the leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of the tall stems. It is most useful for cutting,
as it lasts in water a long time, and is decorative.
It likes good soil, should be sown in April half an
inch deep, and patted down firmly when sown. As
soon as the seedlings can be handled they must
be thinned out; but there will be none to thin if
you cannot keep away slugs. Many gardeners
recommend you to dust the young plants with
soot or lime.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Godetias.</span></h3>

<p>These, too, are useful for cutting, and can
be grown in a variety of delicate colours. We
think that Sutton’s Double Rose and Crimson
King are two of the best. The sprays of the
Double Rose are like Oleander flowers. They
are not quite as tall as Malope or Clarkia,
but should be treated in the same way, and if
well grown will be tall enough for the centre
of your garden.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Larkspurs.</span></h3>

<p>In ‘The English Flower Garden’ Mr. Robinson
says that ‘the annual Larkspurs are so little used
in gardens that it is only in seed-farms that we
have the pleasure of seeing them now and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
in all their beauty.’ You can have them in
various heights and colours, and for early or
late flowering. The earliest flowering ones are
the Dwarf Rocket Larkspurs, and the pink ones
are beautiful flowers. They are twelve inches
high. If you buy seeds of the taller kinds, you
must put them towards the back of your border,
for they grow three feet high. Of these the
Rosy Scarlet is the best.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nigella.</span></h3>

<p>This is one of the most beautiful annuals there
is, and its charming English name is Love-in-a-mist.
Be sure to get the variety called Miss
Jekyll, after the celebrated gardener. The
flowers are a delicate yet vivid blue, surrounded
by fennel-like leaves. They are easy to arrange
for the room, and last well in water. The seed
may be sown in March to bloom in June, and
again in April or May for a later display. The
seed-pods that succeed the flowers are ornamental,
and those that ripen early in the summer
sow themselves and flower in the following year.
Some people say they can transplant Nigella,
but many gardeners prefer to sow it where it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to stand. Thin out when the plants can be
handled, as each one left, if well grown, will
cover a square foot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nasturtium.</span></h3>

<p>Everyone knows Nasturtiums, and the most
ignorant gardeners can grow them. But they
are so beautiful that good gardeners make room
for them, too. They succeed best on poor soil.
If you give them rich soil, they ‘run to leaf,’
as gardeners say, and do not produce many
flowers. Even in a London square they will
make a gay corner, provided they get sun. You
probably know that there are two kinds—the
dwarf ones, growing about nine inches high, and
the Giant Nasturtiums, that will climb to the
top of a tall fence, and cover it in the course
of the summer. The seed should be sown at the
end of April where it is to flower. We have
transplanted Nasturtiums with great success, but
it is not usually recommended. Sow each seed
separately in a little hole two inches deep that you
make with a stick. If you want a whole row of
them, sow two quite near each other, then a foot
farther on another pair, and proceed in this way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
all along your row. When the seedlings are up
you can remove one of each pair, and you will
not have an ugly gap in your row where a single
seed has failed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sunflowers</span> (<span class="smcap">Helianthus</span>).</h3>

<p>If you have a small garden full of delicate
flowers, we should advise you not to grow Sunflowers
at all. A group of them looks well in a
shrubbery or at the back of a mixed border, and
we have seen them used with admirable effect
in a straight row, standing like sentinels on
guard behind all the other plants in the bed; but
they take up room, and require a great deal of
food. If you want them, and your garden was
not dressed in the autumn, some well-rotted
compost should be dug in for the Sunflowers
in spring. The young plants will not stand
frost, and are usually raised in heat; but you
can grow them quite successfully under a bell-glass,
or, in warm parts of England, in the open
ground. If you mean to raise them in this way,
you must wait till quite the end of April or
the beginning of May. The big seeds should be
covered with an inch and a half of soil, and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
you sow where they are to stand, put two close
together to provide against failure. If both come
up and live, the smaller of the two can be removed.
Slugs devour the young plants if they can get
at them, so you should put a little soot round
each one. They need strong stakes, as most
of them grow to a great height, and are easily
blown down. There are some, however, that are
not more than four feet high, and have a great
many small flowers useful for cutting. Stella and
Primrose Stella are good dwarf varieties.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Shirley Poppies.</span></h3>

<p>If you happen to have a rough bank or a piece
of waste ground where nothing much will grow,
you can make it bright with annual Poppies, and
if you let them seed themselves, they will come
up in quantities year after year. They prefer a
light soil to a heavy one, and they must have
sun. It is of no use to sow Poppy-seed in a
shady garden. In the border the amateur
gardener invariably sows too much seed, and
when it comes up his troubles begin. Poppy-seeds
are small and cheap, and as a rule every
seed germinates. You sow it in fine soil, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
either cover it lightly or just rub it in with your
hand. If you have not been careful to sow only
the tiniest pinch mixed with sand, you will soon
see the seedlings as thick as cress above the soil,
and if you leave them you will not have any
good plants, as Poppies want room to grow.
They have tap-roots, and will not transplant, so
you must thin them hard, leaving them at least
six inches apart. Shirley Poppies have delicate
stalks, and when you grow a clump in your
garden, you should put a few stakes amongst
them, and tie them with raffia or string, as otherwise
they get beaten down and spoiled by a
summer storm. The seed should be sown at the
end of April. The Shirley Poppies have most
beautiful colours, and they will last some time
in water if you cut them when the buds are just
beginning to show colour. Wilks’s re-selected
Shirley is one of the best varieties. The Peony
and Carnation-flowered Poppies make larger and
stronger plants than the Shirleys. They should
be sown in the centre of a small garden, and will
make a great show in July.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Alonsoas.</span></h3>

<p>The Alonsoa, or Mask-flower, comes to us from
Peru, and is a most satisfactory annual because
it is easily grown and goes on flowering until the
winter frosts come. There are several varieties,
and one of the best—the Alonsoa Warscewiczii—has
a name you remember because it is so queer,
but will never know how to pronounce, unless
you have Polish or Russian friends to tell you.
Its flower is bright scarlet, and if you look at it
closely you will see that it is like a small snapdragon.
You must be careful to put a label
where you sow it, and watch for a colony of
seedlings all alike, because the seed-leaves of the
Alonsoa are very much like one of our commonest
weeds.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Eschscholtzia.</span></h3>

<p>These are often called Californian Poppies.
They are white, pink, and various shades of
yellow, and they have feathery green foliage.
They succeed in almost any soil, and may be
sown either in spring or autumn. Slugs and
snails do not like them, so if you are much troubled
with these pests you should certainly have some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Californian Poppies. They will seed themselves
in most situations, and the same plant will often
flower a second year. They are described in seed
catalogues as nine inches high, but though they
really grow rather taller than that, it is not usual
to stake them. At the same time, these and
many other flowers inclined to straggle a little
may be supported with great advantage, just as
Sweet-peas are, by a few branched stakes of Hazel
or some similar wood. When you treat a non-climbing
plant in this way, your stakes should be
rather shorter than the plant, and artfully hidden
by its leaves. No tying is necessary where these
branched stakes are used.</p>

<p>Messrs. Sutton and Sons, of Reading, have
consented, at our request, to sell three collections
of flower-seeds suitable for children’s gardens.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>HARDY PERENNIALS</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">A perennial</span> is a plant that comes up year
after year, and increases as it grows older. We
will tell you how to grow fourteen of the best,
and when you have succeeded with those you
can find hundreds more described in ‘The
English Flower Garden’ and other well-known
books. Your parents and grandparents can
remember when all the beautiful herbaceous or
perennial plants were hardly to be found in
gardens, and everyone was content with the
straight rows of red, blue, and yellow, the ignorant
gardener will still inflict on you if you let him.
In those days bulbs were planted in autumn and
dug up in spring, to make way for Geraniums,
Calceolarias, and Lobelias. Everyone grew the
same things, had an ugly clash of colour at the
same moment, and bare brown borders for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
greater part of the year. Then came some of
the great gardeners of thirty years ago, who set
the gardening world ablaze with their reforms and
their audacities. They told people how dull and
stupid their gardens were, and how to make them
beautiful and interesting. It was not their fault
if some of their disciples ran away with the idea
that a herbaceous border was the easiest thing
in the world to manage, and were grievously
disappointed to find that it was not. As a
matter of fact, the incompetent gardener and the
local nurseryman had known very well what
they were about all the time. It is expensive,
but not difficult, to stuff your borders full of
Dutch bulbs in November, and full of little
plants out of pots in May. You could do it
yourself with money and a length of string tied
to two sticks, for you must get your lines straight.
But, then, think of all the beautiful plants you
would never see in your garden—plants that, to
come to their full beauty, must be left undisturbed
until they show you who understand
them that they are ready for your attention, and
require fresh soil or possibly division. In most
gardens there are some beds that are planted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
twice a year, because a show of spring and
autumn colour is wanted in them; but in all
gardens managed with any skill or knowledge
there are now also herbaceous borders, where you
will find all the plants we are going to tell you
about, many other perennials for which we have
no room, and some annuals, hardy and half hardy.
The finest bit of gardening known to one of the
authors is the herbaceous border at Hampton
Court, and she must admit that she knows
neither the Palace nor its pictures nearly as well
as the noble groups of plants that all through
the summer and autumn make a blaze of colour
there. If you have any good garden of hardy
perennials within reach, you should visit it at
different times of the year, and try to learn some
lesson about the habit and arrangement of the
plants. You will come back to your own garden
in despair, but that is better for you than staying
at home and being too easily satisfied. It is well
to know the best that is done in any art or
industry one tries to practise.</p>

<p>The hardy perennials we are going to describe
will flourish in any English garden that has good,
well-dressed soil, and is open to the sun part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the day. In choosing which you will grow you
must consider their colours, their height, their
flowering season, and the rate at which they
increase. You should not give a delicate-looking
plant like a Columbine a coarse spreading neighbour
that will choke it. Nearly all herbaceous
plants are greedy feeders, and require a deep,
well-dug soil. If you cannot have manure
worked in, perhaps you can buy a little bone-meal
and soot. In any case, you should dig the
ground well over before planting, break up hard
lumps, and remove large stones.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hardy Perennials.</span></h3>

<ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Polyanthus and Coloured Primrose.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Delphinium, or Larkspur.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Oriental Poppy.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Iris Germanica.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Perennial Lupin.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Japanese Anemone.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Aquilegia, or Columbine.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Peony.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Œnothera Fruticosa, or Evening Primrose.</li>
<li>10. Gypsophila Paniculata.</li>
<li>11. Sweet Lavender.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></li>
<li>12. Early-flowering Chrysanthemums.</li>
<li>13. Violet.</li>
<li>14. Michaelmas Daisy.</li></ul>




<h3><span class="smcap">Primrose and Polyanthus.</span></h3>

<p>There are more than a hundred kinds of
Primrose, or Primula; nearly all are hardy, and
many grow in clusters on a single stalk. We
are only going to tell you about the common
Polyanthus, which grows in big clusters, and
about the coloured garden Primrose, which is
mostly found with single flowers, like the yellow
Primrose of our fields and hedges. Perhaps you
have heard of Peter Bell, and how</p>

<p class='poem'>
‘A Primrose by the river’s brim<br />
A yellow Primrose was to him,<br />
And it was nothing more.’<br />
</p>

<p>We have met many a Peter Bell, who stared at
us in amazement when he saw us planting corners
in a wild garden with what he considered hedgerow
weeds.</p>

<p>But nowadays people who have gardens try to
see with the poet’s eye, rather than with the eyes
of a Peter Bell. In the moist, shady places of
your garden you may plant Primroses and Polyanthuses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
in colonies, and leave them to grow into
great clumps and to seed themselves. But the
best of them, those that you want to increase,
you must pull to pieces when they have done
flowering, and plant out in a shady corner.
When you take up a clump you will usually see
that it divides easily into several plants. You
need not be afraid to use a knife in some places.
Our experience is that every bit will grow, provided
it has a few roots and plenty of shade and
moisture during the hot summer months. When
autumn comes you will have increased your stock
without expense, and can plant out your young
ones wherever you want them. If you want
blue Primroses, division is more certain than seed.
But it is a most fascinating business to grow
Primroses from a good strain of seed, and not too
difficult for a child to manage. You must get
one of the empty sweetmeat or fancy soap boxes
so invaluable to gardeners, and ask someone to
make half a dozen holes in the bottom with
a gimlet, or even a nail. Put in broken crocks
and fine moist earth, just as we told you
to do for annuals; then sow and lightly cover
your Primrose or Polyanthus seed, put your box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in the shade, keep off slugs, and possess your
soul in patience, for the seed takes a long while
to germinate, and you may not see any tiny
crinkled leaves for weeks. When you do see
them you must wait till they are large enough to
prick out, and even then we advise you to take
them up carefully and keep the box of soil for
a time, as backward seeds often come up later.
Fresh seed will germinate more quickly than last
year’s, so you can either buy a packet in June
and wait some time for results, or you can sow
your own ripe seed in August, in which case your
little plants should be big enough by the end of
November to survive an ordinary English winter.
If you sow in June, you should be able to prick
out a good many little plants in August (on a
damp day), and these will be ready for a front
border by the following spring. When you
prick out put the little plants in rows three inches
apart each way; choose a shady place, and look
out for slugs. It may be necessary to dust with
soot or lime. Primroses and Polyanthuses make
a charming border, either by themselves or mixed
with other hardy plants that flower in spring, such
as Aubrietias, the yellow Alyssum, and Iberis;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
or they look well in clumps on a rockery. If
you have a whole row of them in front of your
border, you should, if possible, take them up
when they have done flowering, and, if they are
worth keeping, put them in some shady unseen
corner through the summer months. The hot
sun makes their leaves yellow and shabby-looking,
and if you can shift them you can have a summer
edging of some dwarf annual or bedding plant.
For instance, when you take up your Primroses
you can sow your Tom Thumb Nasturtiums,
or, if you are near nurserymen, you can buy
some dwarf Snapdragons or some blue Lobelias.
We would never have a straight row of anything
but Sweet-peas if we could help it, and in a mixed
border such as yours even they would look better
grown in the round clumps. But we warn you
that this question of rows or clumps is a burning
one, about which even the two authors of one
book are not always agreed. You will have to
fight it out with your garden and your gardening
friends.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Delphinium, or Larkspur.</span></h3>

<p>Everyone who grows any herbaceous plants
grows some Delphiniums, because they make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
fine background, and are such lovely shades of
blue. Mr. Robinson says they range from one to
nine feet high, but we think yours will probably
be from three to four feet high, and that you
should put them at the back of your border, with
white Lupins, Starworts, and Evening Primroses.
They flower in June and July, and make large
clumps if left undisturbed for several years. There
are two ways of prolonging their flowering season.
You can cut off each flower before it begins to
form seed-pods, or you can cut down the whole
plant when its leaves begin to look shabby, and
let it start afresh, as it did in the spring. But
this would exhaust your plant if you did not give
it extra food; so if you cut it down, it should
have a little liquid manure. A teaspoonful of
Clay’s Fertilizer to a gallon of water would do
very well. Delphiniums like manure, but they
will grow in almost any soil, and are easy to raise
from seed—at least, the seed germinates easily.
They can be sown in May if you buy the seed,
or in August if you wait for your own to ripen.
You sow them in a box, and prick them out when
large enough to handle. When they are a year
old they begin to flower, but a plant does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
make a good clump till it is two or three years
old. The culture of Delphiniums would present
no difficulties if slugs were not so fond of them.
In some gardens it is almost impossible to grow
these beautiful flowers, because the slugs devour
both the seedlings and the young shoots of the
older plants the moment they appear. You must
not put them in places where slugs can hide
easily and come out at night to feed. If you
want to increase your stock by division, you
should do it either in spring or in damp summer
weather, about a fortnight after you have cut your
plant down. The autumn is not a good time.
If you live in a cold climate you should give
your Delphiniums a little protection in winter,
but this is not necessary in most parts of England.
Anyhow, when spring comes and open weather,
take care that your covering of dead bracken or
manure is not protecting slugs.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Papaver Orientale, or Oriental Poppy.</span></h3>

<p>Papaver Orientale and its variety Papaver
Bracteatum are the biggest of all Poppies. The
flowers are brilliant scarlet, with a deep purple-black
spot at the base of each petal. If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
gather the buds just as they are about to
burst, they will live in water for several days.
After the plants have flowered they should
be cut down, and they will reappear in the
autumn. They have long tap-roots that are
easily injured, but where they flourish they
spread laterally—that is, they send up young
plants at the side. These you can take up.
Whenever a plant has a root like a carrot, it is
called a ‘tap-root,’ and you must be careful not
to break it. Poppies are easily raised from seed,
but the plants will not flower till they are two
years old. When you take up your seedlings,
remove each one with as much earth as possible,
and plant it where it is to remain.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Irises.</span></h3>

<p>Roughly speaking, Irises may be divided into
two classes—those you grow from bulbs, and
those that have rhizomes, or creeping stems. The
bulbous Irises are often called Xiphions, and
will not be considered in this chapter. There is
a great variety amongst those that have rhizomes,
or stems. They vary a good deal as to the soil
and conditions they require. Some like damp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
some hate it; some want stiff soil, some a light
one; manure that feeds one Iris will poison
another; and as for their blooming season, it
extends throughout the year if you have a large
collection. The Iris is sometimes called the
‘poor man’s Orchid,’ because it can be grown
without trouble or expense, and has such beautiful
and curious flowers. We will tell you the
names of a few that you can get at any good
nursery garden; but before you plant them you
must consider that each kind is only in flower
for a short time, and that for the greater part of
the year a clump of Irises is a clump of sword-like
leaves. They are sometimes placed amongst
roses or in front of shrubs. The best known of
all is the Iris Germanica, or German Flag.
There are many varieties, and there is hardly
a garden in or near London without some clumps
of it, for even in soot and smoke it will increase
and flower. The beautiful white, pale mauve
Florentine Iris is the French Fleur-de-lis, and
was freely planted in English gardens when the
Bourbons were restored in 1830. It increases
rapidly, and is easy of cultivation. Iris Stylosa
is one of the most valuable, because it flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in winter, and is very fragrant. Then, some of
the dwarf Irises are most beautiful, and should
have a corner in front of your border or on your
rockery. Iris Pumila or its varieties grow some
inches high, and flower in spring. Iris Olbiensis
and Iris Chamæris belong to this group, and in
warm localities flower at the end of April or
early in May. These kinds all thrive best in
an open, warm situation. Irises are easily divided
in the autumn, but each piece should have an
eye to grow from, a little knot or knob that is on
the rhizomatous root. If you want your Irises
indoors, you should gather them in bud, and
arrange them and some of their leaves in a bowl,
with the help of some soft lead and a few stones.
You can get the Japanese lead at most big shops
now for a few pence, but any ironmonger could
supply you with strips of thin sheet-lead. A
pennyworth of copper wire twisted into a tangle
is even better, but this is not so generally known.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lupinus Polyphyllus Albus.</span></h3>

<p>There are blue and white Lupins, and both
kinds flower at the same time and require the
same treatment. We advise you to choose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
white one if you have blue Delphiniums, as they
will come out together, and make your garden
gay all through June. Slugs are very fond of
Lupins, and you often find a fine spike just
about to flower half eaten away. Unless you
want to increase your stock from seed, you
should cut off the flowers as they fade, in order
to prolong the flowering season. The plants
may be left undisturbed year after year, and will
make large clumps that grow from three to six
feet high. If you take up a Lupin you will find
it has huge tap-roots, and on this account it is
not an easy plant to transplant or divide. When
you want to move them, you must do it in the
autumn, after the leaves have died down. The
seeds come up easily if you sow them in a box,
and the seedlings flower the second year; but
if you have blue and white Lupins, the seed
from your white Lupin will produce many
washed-out blue flowers.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">White Japanese Anemone.</span></h3>

<p>This is a large white Anemone with golden
anthers. It begins to bloom in August, and
goes on right through the autumn, long after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
our summer flowers have gone. Any bit of root
you can buy or get given will grow, but when
once you have planted it you should leave it
alone year after year. It hates being disturbed,
and will only make the huge flowering clump
you want when it is well established. It likes
a rich soil, and grows very well in half-shady
places.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Aquilegia, or Columbine.</span></h3>

<p>If you gather the flower of a Columbine and
look at it upside down, you will see why people
say it is like little doves drinking, and how it
gets its name of Columbine from the Latin word
for dove. In some parts of England they grow
wild, but the beautiful orange, yellow, and
scarlet ones come from America, and the blue
and white Alpine ones from Switzerland and the
Pyrenees. In our climate they are uncertain as
perennials. You may have a garden where they
live for years, or you may find that your good
ones die off every year. They like well-drained,
well-nourished, rather light, moist soil, and a
half-shady position. If you have heavy clay
land, you will probably not succeed well with
them. Where they are happy they seed themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
easily, and you see a whole colony of tiny
plants coming up round their parent; so be careful
how you weed near a good Columbine after
it has flowered. These seedlings may be left till
the spring, and then planted where they are to
stand. The best way to acquire a stock is to
buy a packet of seed of the long-spurred varieties,
and to manage them as we have told you to
manage other seeds of perennial flowers. If you
sow in June you should be able to plant out in
autumn, and one of the great growers tells you
to put three plants in a triangle three inches apart,
but we think this is too near. As the leaves die
down in winter, you should put labels where you
set your plants. When you have a great many
seedlings from a mixed packet, do not keep only
the biggest and strongest specimens, or you may
find next summer that you have all one colour.
Some of the choicest varieties look rather small
and weak when they are young.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Peony.</span></h3>

<p>When Keats talked of the wealth of ‘globèd
Peony,’ he was thinking of the old-fashioned red
ones that make such a splendid splash of colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
in a garden, but were out of favour at one time
because they were considered too flamboyant for
people with refined tastes. Your grandmother
would have looked disapprovingly at a hoyden
whose face was as red as a Peony, and she
probably thought the flowers very well in a
cottage garden, but not in her own. But in these
days of hockey and lawn-tennis Atalanta’s face
may be as red as she pleases—no one will call her
a hoyden; and the Peonies are no longer globed,
but wide-open and wide-eyed, like an Anemone,
and lovely shades of palish pink and white. You
can still grow the old red one if you wish. It is
called ‘officinalis,’ and, like all Peonies, should
have four feet of space allowed for the bush it will
make in two or three years’ time. Some of the
most beautiful new ones are half single, with
a mass of golden stamens in the centre, and many
are sweet-scented. They should not be planted
on an east border, because then the sun catches
the dewdrops still on the blooms, and converts
them into burning glasses. They will grow in
any rich soil and in any position, but if you give
them moderate shade their flowers last longer
and are more intense in colour. It is a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
plan to pinch off the buds of your first-year
plants, so that all the strength goes into the roots
and leaves. You may leave them undisturbed for
years, but if you can top-dress them in autumn
so much the better. Peonies form large woody
roots, with little knobs or crowns on them. They
may be divided in autumn by carefully cutting
apart the roots, leaving several crowns on each
piece. These should be planted only two inches
below the soil.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Evening Primrose</span> (<span class="smcap">Œnothera Fruticosa</span>).</h3>

<p>There are a good many varieties of the Evening
Primrose, and one of the most common will be
described in the chapter on Biennials. The
Œnothera Fruticosa is a true perennial, and as it
flowers all through the summer, it is a useful
plant to have in your border. It grows about
two feet high, so it should be placed about the
middle, with taller plants behind it. All Evening
Primroses like a warm, sunny position, and a good
sandy soil. ‘Fruticosa’ is easily raised from seed
sown in the open ground in June, and pricked off
when large enough to flower next year. It may
also be divided in spring or autumn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Gypsophila Paniculata.</span></h3>

<p>This forms a little bush of tiny white flowers,
and sprays of it are charming when mixed with
other flowers. It thrives in any soil when once it is
established, but it dies quite down in winter, and
shows itself rather late in spring; so you must be
sure to mark it with a label in the autumn, and
look out for slugs when the new leaves push
up. We have found it a most difficult plant to
transplant or divide, and we strongly advise the
inexperienced gardener to leave any specimens
he has alone. Gypsophila Paniculata can be
grown from seed sown in the open ground in
May, and moved into the flowering border in
September; but you are not likely to want
many plants of it, and we think you would find it
more satisfactory to buy two or three from one
of the many nurserymen who raise it in large
quantities.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet Lavender.</span></h3>

<p>This plant is a small perennial shrub, and not a
true herbaceous perennial; but we think that
every child will wish to have at least one Lavender
bush, if not more, in the garden. If you choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
you can make a charming hedge of Lavender
mixed with little pink monthly Roses. You can
easily increase your supply by taking cuttings
in August and planting them in light sandy soil.
You must make a slanting slice across your
cutting just beneath the joint, take off every
scrap of green leaf from the lower part of the
stem, and plant firmly three inches deep in sandy
soil. They should strike and make good roots
by the following spring. Lavender may also be
grown from seed sown in boxes in April, and kept
covered with a glass till the little plants appear.
This may take some time, and you must be
careful to keep the soil moist by watering with a
fine rose. When your plants are an inch high,
prick out in rows and leave them for a year.
By the second year they should begin to bloom.
Gather your flowers for keeping on a dry day,
and just before they are fully expanded.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Early-flowering Chrysanthemums.</span></h3>

<p>Many of these are quite hardy, come up year
after year, and require little attention. All
chrysanthemums are greedy feeders, and like a
rich soil, improved by farm manure. In summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
you can, if you choose, give them a watering with
liquid manure made by a teaspoonful of Clay’s
Fertilizer to one gallon of water.</p>

<p>About the end of October, when the flowers
all look shabby, or have been gathered for indoor
use, your plants should be cut down to within
an inch of the ground. This helps the new
growth from which you may want to take
cuttings. You must wait till the young shoots
are six inches high, and then cut them off close
to the ground with a sharp knife. The leaves
must be removed from the lower half of the stalk,
and you must make a clean cut across the stalk
just below a joint from which leaves have been
taken. You can put six of these cuttings in a
five-inch pot, or a large number in a wooden box;
and remember that cuttings root better close to
the edge of a pot than in the middle. They
should be set two inches deep, and firmly pressed
in, and the soil should be fine and mixed with
sand. The pots or boxes must then be placed
in a cool frame or greenhouse. The less you
water cuttings the better, but a sprinkle may
be necessary sometimes to keep the soil moist.
In six weeks the cuttings should have rooted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
begin to make little new leaves at the top. These
may then be pricked out singly into small pots.
Do not put young plants into the open garden
until the spring frosts are over. If you have no
frame or greenhouse, and yet want to increase
your Chrysanthemums, you can take them up at
the end of March, divide them with a sharp knife,
and replant the pieces. A gardener who tried
this way wrote to <i>Gardening Illustrated</i> to say
that the chrysanthemums he divided came into
flower earlier and made stronger plants than the
orthodox cuttings. He took his up in February
and March, and put his pieces in a frame for
a few weeks. But if you have no frame, you had
better wait till the winter frosts are over.</p>

<div class="caption">LARKSPURS AND PINKS.</div>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Violets.</span></h3>

<p>Violets will make no show in your garden, but
if you have room you will wish to have some
of your own to gather. You must put out of
your head some of the things the poets say about
them, and remember that they like a rich soil,
the sun in early spring, some shelter, and plenty
of light and fresh air. We have seen them
belying all the pretty traditions about their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
modest and retiring ways. They were scrambling
in sheets over the granite walls of a Cornish
garden, and, so far from hiding, they were showing
their pretty faces to the sun, and saying as plain as
plain, ‘This is what we like. <i>Don’t</i> stuff us into
shady dells and enclosed, sunless places.’ So now
we put them where they will have rich soil, sun
and air, and the moisture they require. A south
border would be too dry for them in summer, but
they will stand a good deal of sunshine if their
roots are in rich soil. You must watch for their
runners, and cut them off all through the summer,
but later in the year you should leave some for
stock. In May or June you can increase your
Violets—either by taking up your plants and
pulling them carefully to pieces, when every bit
with roots will grow; or you can put some
runners under a hand-light in a shady border. If
you cut off their tips, you will be able to see
when they have struck and begin to grow, and
then you must tilt your hand-light a little,
so as to give ventilation. After a short time
you can take it away altogether, and by
September your cuttings should be ready to
plant out. The rows should be one foot apart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
The plants will soon spread, and should be kept
well weeded. All gardeners advise you to make
a fresh bed every two years. There are many
beautiful varieties. In a Cornish garden we have
known the fine double kind, Marie Louise, bloom
incessantly from August, through the winter and
spring, till the hot weather came again; but this
variety would need a frame in a cold climate.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Michaelmas Daisies, or Starworts.</span></h3>

<p>You must be sure to have some of these in
your garden, because they are easy to grow and
come into flower in September, when many things
are over. They are delightful, too, for cutting,
as they last well in water and look well in any
size or shape of bowl or glass. The only complaint
people ever make of them is that they
increase too fast, and take up too much room in
the borders. We have had the best flowering
clumps sometimes from patches we have dug up
in autumn or spring, pulled to pieces and divided.
But a clump may be left year after year, if convenient.
There is all the difference in the world
between Michaelmas Daisies grown in rich soil
and good air and those grown in starved conditions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
We have seen an inexperienced gardener buy a
collection from good nurserymen, plant them in
a bed of starved, poor soil on the east side of a
suburban house, and then be surprised that her
Starworts made no growth, and were not worth
looking at. And, as it happened, we saw a handful
of Aster Amethystinus taken from those
miserable conditions to a sunny, sheltered garden
in West Cornwall, where it was pulled to pieces
and planted in good soil all along a low granite
wall running north and south. In October a
whole row of healthy plants was looking over the
wall, and sending up masses of clear mauve starry
flowers; their very colour and size improved
out of knowledge by the change. Michaelmas
Daisies lose much of their beauty if they are tied
up in untidy bundles; but it is impossible to avoid
tying them if they stand in an open border where
they may be caught by autumn gales. They
look very well amongst shrubs, or if you have a
fence or a wall you can put them all along it.
Drive a stout stake in at either end, and tie a
strong string or length of coir rope so as to catch
your Starworts at the height that will best support
them. If you must have unprotected clumps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
be sure to stake and tie them as soon as they are
tall enough, and before they flower. There are
many beautiful varieties. Four of the best are
Amellus, Acris, Cordifolius, and Vimineus.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Staking.</span></h3>

<p>This is such an important operation that we
must give it a paragraph to itself. You must
try from the beginning to tie up your plants
when they require it, and to do it in a workmanlike
way, but you will often find it a difficult and
troublesome thing to do well. We once saw an
amusing picture in a gardening book of how not
to tie up a plant, and many a time have we
remembered it after a hot and weary struggle
with our own. Some plants are more easily and
successfully supported by the branched stakes
that need no ties; but heavy plants, such as
Dahlias, Sunflowers, and Michaelmas Daisies, require
strong pointed sticks, either those cut from
trees or the square green ones to be bought in
towns. You should hammer your stake firmly
in just <i>behind</i> the plant. Never drive one straight
through its heart. Consider to what height your
plant will grow, and do not mind if the stake is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
too tall just at first. Tie it carefully with raffia,
or, if you want something stronger, with thin cord.
Roughly speaking, we should say that raffia is
strong enough for plants that can be supported
by the little round stakes sold in bundles, but
that plants needing the square Dahlia stakes also
need strong ties. If you support your plants
while they are young, you must look at them
from time to time, because as they spread and
grow they will want fresh ties and sometimes
fresh stakes. A spreading, top-heavy plant often
needs three or four stakes to support it properly.
You will not think your trouble has been thrown
away, however, when you find that a three-days
storm has not done much damage to your garden,
because your plants were so carefully prepared
for it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>BULBS, CORMS, AND TUBERS</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">A True</span> bulb has a series of layers, or scales. An
onion is a bulb, and so is a Hyacinth; so are
Lilies, though of a different kind. A Crocus, a
Gladiolus, and a bulbous Iris, are all corms. They
are solid, and could not be pulled to pieces in
scales. A tuber is a thick fleshy root that increases
as the plant grows, and ripens when it has
done growing. Dahlias and Begonias have roots
of this kind; so have many Anemones and many
wild flowers. Certain tubers are good to eat.
You have one kind for dinner whenever you
have Potatoes, and another kind when you have
Jerusalem Artichokes.</p>

<p>Some people buy fresh bulbs every year, and
pull up the old ones directly they have done
flowering. We think that if you are a really-truly
gardener, you will not wish to do this. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
will want to see some of your bulbs come up
year after year, with increasing strength and
beauty; and you will want to take up others at
the right time, divide them or store them, as the
case may be, and replant. But if you do mean
to grow your bulbs year after year and increase
your own stock, you must remember that for
many weeks after the flowering season you have
masses of untidy-looking dying leaves. Therefore
you must plant as artfully as you can in
places where other things will be growing up
close by and attracting attention. The leaves of
bulbs must not be removed until they are quite
dead and come away with a touch, and this does
not happen until the summer sun has baked
them for a long time. While they are green the
bulb is getting strength from them. We shall
only tell you about a few varieties that are inexpensive
to buy and easy to grow. When you
have learned to manage these successfully, you
can try some of the many others you will find
in catalogues and in gardening books. Our
advice to you is to spend your money on one
or two kinds every autumn, and not to buy
a collection. This applies especially to children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
who have a corner of a London garden, because
the collections always include some bulbs (such
as Anemones or the Persian Ranunculus, for
instance) that are not quite easy to grow, and
would do nothing in the town border.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Snowdrops</span> (<span class="smcap">Galanthus</span>).</h3>

<p>If you have any shrubs or trees in your garden,
you can plant your Snowdrops near their roots;
and if they like the soil and the situation, they
will increase quickly. They are very fond of
peat, but they will grow well in any healthy soil,
and they may be left undisturbed year after year.
There are many varieties. One of the largest is
Galanthus Elwesi, but it wants a sheltered spot
and a light soil. If you plant your Snowdrops
in clumps near Crocuses and Winter Aconites, put
at least fourteen or fifteen in a clump, and set
them rather close together. The bulbs should
not touch, but there should not be more than
the breadth of your thumb-nail between each.
Beginners nearly always set their bulbs too far
apart, and then the clumps or rows look stinted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Crocuses.</span></h3>

<p>Another mistake that even older people often
make is to think about buying their bulbs about
a month after they should have been in the
ground. There is a ‘best time’ to plant and a
time that will ‘do.’ The best time to plant
spring flowering bulbs is the end of September.
The difficulty is to find places for them then,
when your border is still gay and crowded. But
some of the summer flowers will be over, and
can be thrown away, and others will be cut down
later, and can have some bulbs tucked under the
soil not far from their roots. Crocuses like to be
planted about three inches deep, and they may be
left undisturbed year after year. You could put
clumps of them on your rockery or in front of
your border, and plant Siberian Squills, winter
Aconites, and Snowdrops near them. Then when
April comes, you could sow Mignonette or Nasturtiums
just behind the dying foliage, and in
time the summer flowers would spread and fill
up the bare places for you. There are seventy
species of Crocus, and many bloom in autumn.
Some of these are wild now in various parts of
England, though they probably came long ago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
from the Pyrenees. You will find the spring-flowering
ones most useful for your border; but
though they are easy to grow, you have to watch
for their two enemies—mice and sparrows. Mice
eat the corms, and sparrows pull the flowers to
pieces in order to get at the stamens, that affect
them as a sedative. It is generally found that
they do not attack the striped ones. If you are
troubled by sparrows you must put little twigs
near your crocuses and wind black cotton from
one to the other. Crocuses seed themselves
freely, and take from two to three years to flower.
You can also lift them in June, and separate the
young corms from the parent one; but you
must not expect these very small corms to flower
the following year.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Siberian Squills</span> (<span class="smcap">Scilla Siberica</span>).</h3>

<p>The flowers of this little bulb are a most
vivid sapphire blue, and you should certainly
have some either on your rockery or in front of
your border. They like a sandy loam, so if you
have a clay soil you should get some sand and
plant your bulbs in it. Set them two inches below
the surface any time from July to September.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
They will increase if left undisturbed, or you may
lift the bulbs in June and carefully separate the
little offsets.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Narcissus, or Daffodil.</span></h3>

<p>If you buy bunches of these flowers you find
that the man who sells them to you calls some
Daffodils, some Narcissi some Polyanthus-Narcissi,
and some Jonquils. But when you
look at a gardening book or a bulb list, you will
find them all under the head of Narcissi. There
are hundreds of varieties, and some are difficult
and delicate, while others increase quickly in
good soil. We fear that the little London
gardener will find that his Daffodils flower the
first year, and never send anything up again
except green leaves; but in the country the
strong kinds, such as Emperor or Horsfieldi,
have been known to increase twentyfold in two
years.</p>

<p>The best time to plant these bulbs is in August
or September, but when they are to replace
summer-flowering plants they have to go in later.
Any good garden soil will suit the Daffodil,
but a stiffish loam is what it likes best. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
bulbs should never come into direct contact
with manure, but if your soil is very poor you
could have some dug in nine to twelve inches
deep. There is some diversity of opinion about
the depth at which to plant, but we have good
authority for saying that from two to five inches
is enough. At St. Loy, the well-known Cornish
flower-farm, the manager believes, after many
careful experiments, that deep planting is a
strain on the bulb, and weakens the growth.
If you are afraid of hard and prolonged frost, it is
better to give your Daffodils a winter blanket of
manure, dead leaves, heather, furze, or ashes,
whichever you can conveniently procure. This
must be removed when the bulbs want to push
through the ground. In June and July, Daffodils
lose both roots and leaves, and may be taken
up for division. The rule about division is
quite simple. When you see a baby bulb
wrapped up to the neck in the sheath of the
parent bulb, you must not take it away, but plant
them again together. It is only when the young
bulb has its own sheath that you may detach
it carefully at its basal root where it still touches
the old one. When you want to separate bulbs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
do not tear them asunder. Press them gently
together, and if they are ripe for separation they
will come apart easily.</p>

<p>When you have dug up those you want to
divide, knock off as much soil as you can, and
leave the bulbs to dry for a short time in the
sun, or on a shelf in a shed or in a cool room.
But it is advisable to plant the young bulbs
directly they are detached from the old ones.</p>

<p>If possible, when you replant your bulbs, give
them a fresh place—or, at any rate, fresh soil.
When you cut your Daffodils, never cut many
leaves from one plant, because the bulb receives
nourishment through its leaves. The flowers
may be gathered when in bud, and will come out
well and increase in size in water. Many people
always send Daffodils by post in bud, as they
travel better, take less room, and last longer.
Besides, a mixture of fully-open and half-open
Daffodils is like spring itself, and gives you
pleasure as they change and expand. But the
growers tell us that the shops and markets will
not buy them in this state, and insist on having
the flowers in full bloom.</p>

<p>The Polyanthus-Narcissus has several flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
on one stalk, and it is very fragrant. There are
several varieties, and in the South and West of
England they are all hardy. In the sheltered
parts of Cornwall and the Scilly Isles they come
into flower before Christmas, and all through
January you see fields of them opening their buds
in the winter sun. If you live in a cold part of
England, you must give them a sheltered corner
and plenty of sand in the soil. Three good kinds
are Soleil d’Or, a bright yellow; Grand Monarque,
white and pale yellow; and Gloriosa,
white and orange. The Polyanthus-Narcissus
does better than other kinds in a stiff soil, and it
likes a little manure.</p>

<p>The variety of Daffodils in a bulb list is bewildering,
but you must learn enough about the
leading kinds to choose, for instance, whether
you want a huge yellow trumpet, a hoop petticoat,
a star, a double, or one of those enchanting
tiny ones that would get lost in a mixed border,
and must be given a choice corner in your
rockery. In this chapter we will give you the
names of a few well-known and inexpensive
kinds that are effective in a mixed border.
When you plant them in this way amongst other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
flowers, you can put six in a clump, three inches
apart and three to five inches deep. They should
be placed eighteen inches from the path, well
behind your Snowdrops, Crocuses, and dwarf
Alpines. You may like to choose those that flower
late, and put them near pale blue Hyacinths or
deep orange Tulips. In that case, buy Emperor,
Empress, or Bicolor. The earliest trumpet Daffodil
is Sir Henry Irving; Golden Spur comes
a little later. Bicolor Grandis is what the catalogues
call ‘the best all-round Daffodil’; Sir
Watkin is ‘a giant of noble appearance’; and
Horsfieldi is pure white and yellow, the finest of
the early Bicolors. All these are single Daffodils.</p>

<p>The Poet’s Narcissus, or the Pheasant-eyed
Narcissus, blooms later than the Daffodils.
These are what the flower-shops give you when
you ask for the single Narcissus, and they have
strongly scented, pure white petals, with a short
yellow cup that is edged with red. If they like
your soil they will increase at a great rate, and if
they don’t they will flower the first year, but never
again. We have known them spread like a weed
in a Yorkshire garden in a good rich loam, and
we have seen them doing well in pure sand. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Les Avants, in Switzerland, there are vast fields
of them, and when they are in flower the scent is
overpowering. They should be gathered just
as the buds break, because the sun soon bleaches
the lovely orange and yellow of the ‘pheasant
eye.’</p>

<div class="caption">DAFFODILS.</div>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hyacinths.</span></h3>

<p>Hyacinths should be planted nine inches deep
and six inches apart. Five or six bulbs of the
same colour make a pretty clump, and they should
be from twelve to eighteen inches from the edge.
You may leave them undisturbed year after year,
and in good soil they will increase and flower.
If you wish to take them up, you must wait till
the leaves are dead, and then dry the bulbs carefully
in the sun before you store them in sand
till the autumn. The offsets, if cultivated in
light, rich soil, will flower in three years; but
Hyacinths raised in Holland are stronger than
any you are likely to raise yourself. Until you
are an experienced gardener, we advise you to
leave your clumps undisturbed as long as they
flower, and to buy new bulbs when you find that
your old ones seem exhausted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Grape Hyacinth (Muscari).</span></h3>

<p>These are charming little blue or white flowers,
growing about six inches high, and flowering in
April. They are hardy and easy to grow, but
you must be sure to put a good many in a group,
so as to get the best effect with them. Plant
them two inches deep and about two inches apart.
The bulbs are easily increased by lifting them
every two or three years when the leaves are
dead, and removing the offsets. They like any
soil except a very damp one, and they look well
in front of your border or in your rockery, near
some of the miniature Daffodils.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tulips.</span></h3>

<p>Tulips are easily grown in any good garden
soil. Where the land is stiff and not well worked
they die out. The proper time to plant is from
October till the middle of November, and, if
possible, you should give your Tulips shelter from
wind, as their heavy heads, brittle stems, and
broad leaves are easily damaged. They should
be planted three inches deep. The ordinary garden
Tulips may be roughly divided into two kinds—early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and late flowering—and of these there are
many varieties. The well-known scarlet and
yellow Duc van Thol and all its family are early,
and will flower in April. The late ones flower
in May and June, and come from <i>Tulipa
Gesneriana</i>. There are so many kinds and
colours in Tulips that we will not give you
names, but leave you to choose your own from
any good catalogue. Perhaps you would like
to try some of the Parrot Tulips, which have
large flowers, most curiously coloured and flaked.
Tulips, unlike most bulbs, may be lifted directly
their leaves turn yellow, dried in the sun, and
stored in a dry, airy place, where mice and rats
cannot reach them. Most kinds are increased by
offsets. You can, if you choose, leave your
Tulips in the ground two or three years, but
after that it is well to take them up and divide
them. If you do not, the bulbs get crowded,
and do not flower well.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Early and Late Flowering Gladioli.</span></h3>

<p>There are two kinds of Gladioli that we think
you can grow in your garden. One is the well-known
Scarlet Brenchleyensis, that flowers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
autumn, and the other is an early-flowering
dwarf variety called Nanus.</p>

<p>The early-flowering ones are white, pink,
salmon, and crimson, and in good garden soil
they increase freely. They should be planted in
November, and you must remember that they
will need protection from frost during their first
winter. Except in very hard weather, the <i>established</i>
bulbs need no covering. They like a light
loamy soil and a sunny situation. When you
have chosen a place for them, set the bulbs, three
inches deep and seven inches apart, in clumps of
about twelve, and have ready some dead leaves
and ashes to keep each clump warm. These dwarf
varieties may be left undisturbed two or three
years, but as they increase quickly they will not
flower well longer than that unless you take them
up, when the foliage is dead, and divide them.
The well-known white one, The Bride, belongs to
this section.</p>

<p>The finest autumn-flowering variety is the
splendid scarlet one—Brenchleyensis. It is
taller than the summer kinds, and should be
placed about the centre of your border. Each
stem should be carefully tied to a stick when it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
about to flower, or a high wind may snap it in
two. This Gladiolus should be planted in the
spring, about four inches deep and twelve inches
apart. When the leaves have died away in the
autumn, the bulbs should be lifted, dried, and
stored in sand for the winter. In the South and
West of England the bulbs are often left in the
ground, but even there they should be protected
the first winter. Every two years they should
be lifted and divided.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Montbretias.</span></h3>

<p>A beautiful little South African flower, like a
small Gladiolus. If you live in a mild climate
it will increase like a weed, and your trouble will
be to keep it down. In a heavy soil or where
there is much frost you must give protection.
But the chief thing to remember about Montbretias
is that they will not flower unless the
clumps are frequently divided in autumn. Some
growers recommend that it should be done every
year.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Irises.</span></h3>

<p>The Spanish and English Irises want conditions
that not everyone can give them. They like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
shelter without shade, drought in autumn and
winter, moisture in spring, sun in summer, and
a light, friable soil. If you have a light soil and
a south wall, you should certainly put some of
these beautiful flowers in, and do not meddle
with the bulbs as long as the plants are doing well.
Plant at least three inches deep and five inches
apart.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Winter Aconite (Eranthis Hyemalis).</span></h3>

<p>The Winter Aconite is welcome because it
comes so early in the spring, and even pushes up
its bright yellow flowers, surrounded by a whorl or
ruffle of glossy leaves, through the snow. It will
grow in almost any garden soil, and is a good
plant to put under shrubs or amongst ferns, as it
does not mind shade. It can be increased by
dividing the tubers in September; but if your
Aconites do well, you can leave them year after
year and let them manage themselves.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Alstrœmerias.</span></h3>

<p>These are beautiful orange-coloured Peruvian
Lilies, and if you have a light, well-drained soil
you will find them easy to grow. If your soil is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
heavy you must dig in leaf-mould, sand, and
well-rotted cow-manure. A warm, sheltered,
sunny position suits them best. While growing
and blooming they should be watered sometimes,
or the plants get too dry. As they go out of
flower you should remove the seed-heads, as
when they all set they exhaust the plant; but do
not cut the stems or leaves, because they are
wanted to strengthen the tubers for the following
year. Their stems are so strong that they do
not require stakes. They should be planted
from six to nine inches deep and twelve inches
apart, and once established, they should never be
disturbed. When the young shoots of the
Alstrœmeria appear in spring, slugs must be kept
away.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Begonias.</span></h3>

<p>Begonias used to be little grown in the outdoor
garden, but of late years you see them everywhere.
We advise you to buy the inexpensive
unnamed tubers in April from any good nurseryman.
When your Begonias arrive you will find
that they look rather like flattened, badly-grown
potatoes, and if you see no little pink shoots on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
them, you must put them in a shallow box of
sand or sandy soil or cocoanut-fibre, and set the
box on a dry light shelf till growth begins. If
you can put your box in a cool greenhouse, so
much the better. The soil must be kept just
moist, but not wet, and the tubers must not be
put out till the spring frosts are over. In cold
climates this will not be till the end of May.
When the time comes, choose positions in front
of your border, and as far as possible sheltered
from high winds, which would play havoc with
their succulent stalks and broad, fleshy leaves.
The soil should be well dug, and if it is heavy
you must add sand, and, when you can get it,
leaf-mould. Take up your tubers very carefully
with a trowel, so as not to injure their fine
fibrous roots, and plant them, with the pink shoots
upwards, about four inches below the surface.
Then you must watch your Begonias carefully,
and when they appear above ground protect them
from slugs by putting a circle of soot round each
plant. You will find Begonias useful as successors
to the spring bulbs that are over, and can
be taken up for division or thrown away. In the
autumn they must come out of the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
before the frosts, and if the leaves and stalks are
not quite dead, cut them off with a sharp knife;
never pull at them, or you may injure the tuber.
Some growers keep their tubers exposed in a
light, airy greenhouse until the stalks and stems
are so shrivelled that they will drop off with a
touch. As long as they are not shrivelled, they
constitute a danger to the tuber during its time
of rest. Begonias must be stored in sand or
cocoanut-fibre in shallow boxes, and kept in a
frost-free place through the winter. They can
be grown from seed or from cuttings under glass,
but we think both operations are a little beyond
the juvenile gardener.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dahlias.</span></h3>

<p>It is difficult to find room for Dahlias in a very
small garden, but even one will give you a great
deal of pleasure if you manage it well, as the
flowers go on for a long time, and are most useful
for cutting. Whether you have one or more,
you must remember that the Cactus Dahlias grow
from four to six feet high, and that each plant
makes a big bush. The pretty little Pom-poms
are rather shorter, and can be placed in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of their big brothers. We advise you to grow
these kinds, and not what are called show
varieties, which are stiff and, we think, ugly.
Dahlias are greedy feeders, and wherever you
mean to plant one you should get someone to dig
in manure eighteen inches down. About the end
of April or early in May, according to the season
and your climate, you put out your Dahlias. If
they are spring-rooted cuttings in a pot, all you
have to do at first is to take them out of the pot,
plant them, and look out for slugs. They will
devour every one if they can. If you are given
a tuberous root, you must put it five or six inches
deep in the ground. It is of no use to grow
Dahlias unless you can stake and tie them properly,
as they become very heavy, and are ruined by
a high wind if unsupported. Stout, square green
stakes are made on purpose for Dahlias, and if
you are far away from a town where they are to
be had, you must get someone to cut and point
you natural ones equally strong. For Cactus
Dahlias they should be five or six feet long, and for
Pom-poms four feet; and at least one foot of this
length must be driven firmly into the ground.
Do not tie with raffia, but with stout cord or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
coir, as nothing else is strong enough. When
the frosts come you can take up your Dahlias and
store them in a dry cellar; but unless you have a
gardener to help you, we do not think you could
strike cuttings from them in heat, in spring. You
will find in autumn that the little plant you put
out of a pot in May has made a big tuber, with a
number of fingers. These should be left as they
are till spring comes again, and then they may be
carefully separated with a sharp knife and put as
they are into the ground. Each piece will make
a fresh plant. In sheltered parts of Devonshire
and Cornwall, Dahlias, after being cut down, are
often given a little covering of straw and manure
and left in the ground.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>BIENNIALS</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Biennials</span> are plants that do not flower till the
second year after sowing. They are sown in
spring and summer, pricked out when large
enough, and transplanted, either in the autumn
or the following spring, to their flowering places.
If you can only have a small patch in a small
garden, we advise you to buy, ready-grown, every
spring, the few biennials you need. You can
get all the well-known ones cheaply by the dozen,
or just as they have been sown in a box. But if
you are one of those lucky children who grow up
in a big garden, we advise you to beg for a little
extra bit for a ‘nursery,’ and then to try your
hand at growing some of the easier biennials and
perennials from seed. Some people will tell you
that this operation is beyond the skill and patience
of any child, but we think that if you will follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
our instructions carefully you might succeed.
Do not dream of trying all we tell you about in
one season. In every chapter we speak of more
plants than any one child could crowd into one
small garden. You must choose some of your
great favourites to begin with, and each year add
a few new ones to the plants you have learnt to
manage well.</p>

<p>Skilled gardeners grow some biennials, as
annuals, by raising the seed in frames and greenhouses
early in the year; but this, we think,
would be too difficult for children to do without
help. So you must, as we have said, buy
your biennials ready-made, or you must get
someone to raise them in heat for you, or you
can sow your own seed one year, understanding
that the seedlings will not flower till the
next. Of these three plans we think the purchase
of ready-made seedlings the easiest, but in
some ways the least satisfactory. At any rate,
if you must adopt it, try to get them from good
nurserymen. Those you buy in the London
streets or from advertisement columns are often
grievously disappointing, so that when your
biennials flower you discover you have thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
your money and your labour away. Your Snapdragons
are either hideously splotchy or crudely
magenta; your pink Canterbury Bells are blue
and white; your Wallflowers are spindly and
colourless. A few experiences of this kind will
soon drive you to buy your own seed from one
of the best firms, and for a few pence and some
happy hours of gardening to get more plants
of the best colour and quality than you can
possibly use. Then you will have the pleasure
the true gardener always finds in giving some
of his plants away, or you can exchange your
surplus stock for plants you do not possess yet.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wallflowers (Cheiranthus).</span></h3>

<p>This is a good biennial to start with, because
every seed comes up and comes quickly. Sow
thinly on a partly shaded patch of ground, and
prick out when the seedlings have four good
leaves. Do this on a showery day, if possible,
and plant in rows ten inches apart each way. It
is important to sow your seed early in the spring,
because where the winter is severe the plants
should be in their permanent quarters by May or
June. If you transplant them late in the autumn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
they suffer greatly from frost. In London
market-gardens the seed is sown early in
February; the plants are put out in May, and by
Christmas are in flower. A seedling Wallflower
has a tap-root as well as fibrous roots, and this is
why the seedling should be pricked out once
before it is transplanted to its permanent quarters.
If you left it where it was sown it would send
down a great root like a carrot, and then when
you tried to move the plant you would kill it.
Many gardeners pinch off the tap-root when they
prick out, and then the Wallflower makes fibrous
roots that can be safely transplanted. Mr. Robinson
says that a well-grown Wallflower in a London
market-garden could not be covered by a bushel
basket, so now you know what size your plants
<i>ought</i> to be, and how many you will have room
for in your border. If you buy them ready-made
late in the autumn, you will probably find that
each plant has two bare, lanky stalks, with a
miserable little bunch of leaves at the top; and
when a frost comes they will look so dejected
that you will pull them up and throw them away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pansies and Tufted Pansies (Viola
Tricolor).</span></h3>

<p>The Pansies, or Heart’s-ease, and Tufted
Pansies (known to nurserymen as Violas) can be
treated as annuals, biennials, or perennials,
according to position, climate, and soil. In a
Cornish garden from October to Christmas we
had Pansies in flower from seed sown at the end
of May, so they were annuals. But we had
put them in their permanent places that autumn,
because we wanted them to live through the
winter and make the border gay the summer
following, when they became biennials. At the
end of the summer we kept the best of them
to flower another year, and, if they liked, a year
after that.</p>

<p>The seed should be sown in early summer in
light, moist, leafy soil. It soon comes up, and
when the seedlings have three pairs of leaves
they should be pricked out. The Pansy, like the
Carnation, has a tiresome trick of producing its
best flowers on its poorest plants, so you must
be patient and careful with the weak, backward
ones, because they may give you the finest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
blooms. Pansies would rather be moved in
autumn than in spring, and remember that they
like a rather shady place in your border, and
a good loamy soil. They either die or make
poor little flowers in hard, dry ground. If you
want your Pansies and Violas to go on flowering
all the summer, you must be careful to pinch off
the dead flowers. The roots you see in London
shops and markets, wrapped in hard clay and
showing two or three big flowers, will not do
much good as a rule. If, however, you have
some, and want to keep them alive, you should
soak the cake of clay off the fibrous roots, plant
in a puddle of water, and protect from the sun
and wind for several days with a flower-pot.
We have been told by a well-known gardener
that she can make anything live by planting it in a
pool of water, and out of our own experience we
would say that we can make most things live by
shading them for some days, except from showers,
with a flower-pot. It is most interesting to see
how a flagging plant will revive after a few hours
of shade and shelter.</p>


<p>If you have a light, warm soil, you can easily
strike cuttings from your best Violas and Pansies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
One way is to cut them down in June. A month
later a number of young shoots will appear, and
these should have soil put amongst them into
which they will root themselves. In two or
three weeks you can take away these young
plants and put them in a nursery bed. A cutting
should be set one-third of its length into a little
bed of sandy soil that you have previously made
smooth and moist. You must always slice them
across the stalk just below a joint, and cut off the
lower leaves. They should be taken in moist,
warm weather, and placed in partial shade. As
they grow pinch off the tops, and then they
make more roots, and are stronger. We have
no great gardening authority for saying so, but
from our own experience we should advise you
never to cut down a favourite plant for increase,
except in showery weather. We have lost many
by meddling with them during a drought. If
you only have a few Pansies you will not want
to cut them down at all in June, but you can
look out for young shoots, and try to take a few
cuttings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Campanula Medium</span> (<span class="smcap">Canterbury Bell</span>).</h3>

<p>Canterbury Bells are most useful and beautiful
flowers, and easily grown. If you want the
lovely pink ones be sure to get your seed from
a first-rate firm, as the cheap seed and the
cheap plants are likely to be blue or white. Canterbury
Bells are beautiful in blue and white, as
well as in pink, and we only mean that for
some reason the pink ones seem a little more
difficult to get hold of. Sow your seed in
shallow boxes in March or April; prick out in
showery weather when the seedlings have four
leaves, and transplant to their permanent places
in September. You will find that the strongest
seedlings will flower the following year, but the
small ones take two years to mature. Canterbury
Bells sow themselves easily if you leave the
seed to ripen, but they flower longer if you pick
off each bell as it withers. They require stakes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sweet William</span> (<span class="smcap">Dianthus Barbatus</span>).</h3>

<p>One celebrated lady who writes about gardens
says that she does not like Sweet Williams, because
they remind her of the plush chairs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
German furniture shops. We think ourselves
that the ordinary red ones are rather stiff and
flaunting; but the new salmon-pink and deep
rose-coloured ones are not a bit like red plush,
and they make lovely patches of colour in our
gardens; also, they are easy to raise and
manage. If you grow them from seed, sow out
of doors in April, prick out when the plants
are large enough, and transfer to permanent
quarters in September. Next year you can
take cuttings from the best plants when they
have done flowering. You are always told by
skilful gardeners that a cutting should be sliced
straight through the stalk just beneath a joint,
and planted in sandy soil and slight shade to
make roots; but now we will tell you how an
unskilful gardener, who found cuttings difficult,
increased her Sweet Williams with perfect ease.
It may be the wrong way, but the Sweet
Williams did not seem to think so. When they
had quite done flowering, each plant had sent
up a quantity of young green shoots that
evidently did not mean to make flowers that
summer; so the unskilful gardener took up her
best clumps, tore each one into from twelve to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
twenty pieces, planted them in fine, rather moist
soil in partial shade, and by late autumn saw
that every one was doing well and making a good
plant for next year.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Evening Primrose</span> (<span class="smcap">Œnothera</span>).</h3>

<p>A handsome, clear yellow flower, growing
six feet high, and blooming for many weeks, but
one of those that never know when and where
they are not wanted. You know the true gardening
rhyme, don’t you?—that ‘One year’s
seeding makes seven years’ weeding.’ We believe
that when once the Evening Primrose has
had a chance in a garden, its seeds will come up
there till the crack of doom. However, they
have tap-roots, and are easily pulled up.
If you have none and want them, you should
sow in June where the plants are to stand, and
thin out severely, leaving two feet between the
plants. Remember that in this chapter we are
talking of biennials, that will not flower until the
following year. If you have one of those heart-breaking
gardens made of rough, starved soil or
builder’s rubbish, you might sow Evening Primroses
as carefully as you can all along the back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of the border. Then, in the following spring,
when your Evening Primroses are spreading
plants, you could sow Giant Poppies in front
of them, and Dwarf Nasturtiums in front of
the Poppies. One of the great secrets of gardening
is to find out how to make the best of your
conditions, even when they are unfavourable.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Snapdragons</span> (<span class="smcap">Antirrhinum Majus</span>).</h3>

<p>These are most beautiful and useful flowers.
They will do well in poor soil, and even on the
tops of walls, where there is not much soil for
them—in fact, some of the finest specimens,
grown from self-sown seed, are to be found in
such situations. There are three kinds: tall,
medium, and dwarf, and there are a great variety
of colours. Some are self-coloured, and some
are mottled, striped, or flaked. If you buy
cheap seedlings you get ugly magentas or poor,
washed-out mixtures; while if you raise your
own from good seed, you get most lovely shades.
Snapdragons may be treated as annuals or biennials,
and each has its own difficulty. If you
treat them as annuals, you must raise the seed
under glass in February, so as to have flowers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
July. We think you probably have no greenhouse
or frame of your own, so we will tell you
how to grow Snapdragons out of doors as biennials.
The difficulty in this case is not to get
your stock of plants, but to keep them through
the winter, as Snapdragons are not quite hardy,
especially in a close, damp soil. We have heard
of nursery gardeners losing their whole stock in
a frost. On a light soil and near a south wall
you can, with a hammer and nails and a few
laths, knock up a wooden framework that will
hold a piece of sacking or an Archangel mat over
your plants, and keep the worst of the frost from
them. If you can’t use a hammer and nails, and
live in a cold climate, we think you will have to
buy your Snapdragons every spring.</p>

<p>The seed of Snapdragons is very small, so it
is a good plan to mix it with sand or fine soil
before you sow it. The sowing can be done any
time between April and August, and either in
boxes or pans, or in the open ground. If you
have a struggle with weeds in your garden, we
advise you to sow all seeds that will bear transplantation
in boxes or pans, as you can dodge
the weeds better in this way. We have heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
people who poured a kettleful of boiling water
over the soil they meant to use for seeds, so as
to destroy the weeds in it first. If you do this,
you must wait till the soil has passed through
the soppy stage in which a flood of hot water
leaves it before you put it in your seed-box.
An old iron tray, no longer tidy enough for
indoor use, is convenient for this and for many
other garden operations. When your Snapdragons
have four good leaves, prick them out
in rows nine inches apart in the most sheltered
corner you have, and protect them from frost
till the spring, when they will make a show all
through the summer in your border. You will
find that some people get quite angry with you
for growing tall ones or dwarf ones, according
to the kind they themselves prefer, while other
people will forbid you to look at a flaked or
bizarre Snapdragon. You will have to bear this
if you agree with us, and like both dwarf and
tall ones, all the clear selfs, and even some of the
bizarre. A ‘self’ in gardening jargon means one
colour, as opposed to striped, flaked, or speckled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Forget-Me-Not</span> (<span class="smcap">Myosotis Dissitiflora</span>).</h3>

<p>There are several varieties of the Forget-me-not,
but you will find this a good kind to grow,
either for your border or your rockery. It makes
a charming edging for bulbs, or a carpet through
which Tulips and Daffodils send up their leaves in
spring. The seed should be sown from April to
June, and pricked out into a shady place. In
the autumn your plants can be moved to their
flowering quarters. They look very well near
White Arabis, a plant you can buy anywhere, or
near the Yellow Alyssum.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Foxgloves</span> (<span class="smcap">Digitalis</span>).</h3>

<p>Foxgloves are so beautiful that you will want
to grow them even if you have a sunny, sheltered,
well-dug, and well-dressed garden where anything
will succeed. But they are one of the few
flowers that will never fail you who garden under
difficulties. They do not mind shade, and can
be grown amongst shrubs, and even under trees.
They do not mind poor soil, though they make
a finer growth when they are fed, and they will
endure the air of cities. When once they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
established in your garden, you have them for
ever if you choose, as they seed themselves freely;
but you cannot keep the pure white strain unless
you either grow new ones from good seed or pull
up every pink one before the buds open and let
the bees into their flowers. The bees, as you
no doubt know, are great gardeners, and fertilize
your plants for you.</p>

<p>The seed of Foxgloves should be sown in June,
either in boxes or in the open ground. You can
prick them out to where they are to stand, or
you can sow in their permanent quarters and thin
to nine inches or a foot apart. Remember that
they are tall plants, and must be at the back of
your border. As you get three thousand seeds
for a penny, you will have some over to sow in
wild places.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stocks</span> (<span class="smcap">Matthiola</span>).</h3>

<p>These sweet-scented flowers make a display in
your border all through the spring. They like
a rich, well-dressed soil, and are generally poor
and spindly on a starved one. The Brompton
and Intermediate are good kinds to grow. Sow
the seeds in summer in partial shade, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
moist weather plant out, nine inches apart, where
they are to bloom. Make the soil firm round
the young plants. Mr. E. T. Cook, in his
‘Gardening for Beginners,’ says that amateurs
often make a mistake in rejecting the dwarf
seedlings and keeping only the tall ones. The
dwarf ones have more fibrous roots, and make
more double flowers. The colours of Stocks
have been greatly improved of late years, and if
you get your seed from a good firm you need
not grow the magenta ones you often see in

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>BEDDING PLANTS</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">By</span> bedding plants we mean those plants that
are raised in great quantities under glass, and are
put out into our gardens in May. To be sure,
you hear of ‘spring’ and ‘summer’ bedding,
because in the autumn, when you take up your
summer plants, you can fill your bed with bulbs
and spring flowers, such as Stocks, Wallflowers,
Primroses, and Forget-me-nots. The principal
of ‘bedding’ is, you see, to plant your piece
of ground, so as to have a good display twice
a year. Every autumn you throw away your
summer plants, and every summer you throw
away your spring ones. This, at any rate, is
what thousands of people with small town
gardens do, and it is the form of gardening
beloved of the jobbing gardener and the local
florist. We recommend it to people who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
money, but take no interest in their gardens, and
to small children who will find it the easiest
form of gardening, and even to children who live
in or near great cities where some plants will
lead a merry life, but where none will lead a
long one. But it is not a high form of gardening,
and cannot teach you much as long as you buy
every six months and throw away. Of course,
when you raise and increase your bedders,
either spring or summer ones, you are gardening
in the true sense of the word. But most of the
flowers you see in town gardens from May till
October are raised in heat from seeds and cuttings,
and we think the appliances and the skill required
would be beyond you.</p>

<p>However, even from the throw-away-twice-a-year
plan you can learn the gardening virtues of
order and method, and you can get great pleasure
from the flowers. Besides, you may be able to
adopt it partly, and have some plants that go
on from year to year, some annuals, and some
you cherish for a season and then cast out. We
will assume that in October someone gave you
enough bulbs to make a fine show all through
March and April, but that now in May their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
flowers are gone and their leaves looking shabby.
If you are going to have bedders you must
harden your heart, dig up all the bulbs, and throw
them away. Then you must prepare the soil by
turning it well over and raking it fine. If someone
will fork in a little well-rotted stable manure,
so much the better; if that is not possible, you
can add a small quantity of Clay’s Fertilizer.</p>

<p>Before you buy your bedders you must consider
the aspect of your garden and the state and
nature of your soil. Geraniums and Marguerite
Daisies will stand rather poor soil, but Calceolarias,
Begonias, and Heliotrope want good treatment
if they are to flourish. If you have a wall
at the back of your garden that is only partly
covered, you should put nails a foot apart on
either side and stretch string or wire across.
Wire is more lasting than string, but more
difficult to manage. The next thing to decide
will be what colour effects you want, and for
how many plants you have room. Geraniums need
about a foot square each, Marguerites eighteen
inches, Dwarf Marigolds nine inches. If you
possibly can, buy your Geraniums, Calceolarias,
Heliotropes, and Marguerites in little pots, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
in boxes, or, worse still, in dried-up, rootless cuttings
sent by post. It is an elementary piece of
gardening knowledge that, provided you keep off
slugs and give a little shade and water at first,
you can put anything out of a pot at any time.
But if you are going to have many bedders, you
will save yourself a great deal of trouble by
putting them out in showery weather towards
the end of May.</p>

<p>Some of the best bedders for a small garden
are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dark red and salmon-pink Geraniums;</li>
<li>Scented oak-leaved Geraniums;</li>
<li>White and yellow Marguerite Daisies;</li>
<li>Heliotropes;</li>
<li>Calceolarias.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these can be bought in pots for 3s. a dozen.
Dark red French Marigolds, Pansies, Violas,
Petunias, Musk, and Lobelias can be bought in
boxes holding from eighteen to twenty-four for
1s. or 1s. 6d.</p>

<p>Begonias, which may be had in all colours and
look charming in front of a border, can be had
for 2s. 6d. to 3s. a dozen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>In buying your plants always choose short,
sturdy ones, with plenty of leaves, and not the
tall, weak ones that have been drawn up under
glass. If you have a wall, buy three or four ivy-leaved
pink Geraniums and a penny packet of
blue Convolvulus Major seed. The Geranium will
climb four feet in a season and the Convolvulus
from four to six feet, and they will look well
together. Do not be tempted to put in your
Convolvulus seed till the May frosts are over,
as you only lose by being in a hurry with this
delicate annual.</p>

<p>Never take a plant out of a pot by pulling at
it right side up. Always turn the pot upside
down, with your hand covering the earth, but
not the plant; then tap the bottom of the pot
sharply with your trowel, and usually the plant
will come out. Sometimes it is necessary to
give the edge of the pot (still holding it upside
down) a sharp knock on the top of a wall, or
some other hard surface. You must, of course,
be most careful not to knock the plant as you do
this. If even then it will not come out, you
must break the pot. When you have to do this
you usually find that the plant has been pot-bound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and is a mass of fibrous roots. Before
you put the plant in your border remove the
little pieces of broken pot at its roots, sink it
slightly deeper than its own earth, and make the
soil gently firm about it. If the weather is not
showery, you must give your bedding plants a
good soak when you have put them in. Soft
water (rain-water is always soft) is much better
for plants than hard water from a tap; but if you
cannot get this try to keep some hard water in a
tub, so that it is exposed to the sun and air before
you use it. The general rule is never to water
plants when the sun is on them, but if we saw a
plant flagging badly in the sun we should not
wait till evening, but give it water at its roots,
and, if possible, shade it. We should be careful
not to let any water touch its leaves. When
once your plants are well established do not
water at all, except in a long drought. Then, if
you begin, you must go on every evening till
the rain comes. Geraniums and Marguerites
do not like much water. Musk is very thirsty,
and so are Petunias and Tobacco plants.</p>

<div class="caption">A CORNISH COTTAGE.</div>
</div>

<p>Be careful not to mix your colours in the ugly
way often seen in London and suburban gardens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
You might have a row of white Tobacco plants
at the back of your border, then one of yellow
Marguerites, then Heliotrope, then Calceolarias
and dark French Marigolds, then mauve Violas,
and in front yellow Musk. Or if you want red
and white, or red, white, and blue, you could try
dark red Geraniums, then oak-leaved Geraniums,
then white Marguerites, then dark red Begonias,
and in front either blue Lobelias or the scarlet
Alonsoa Warscewiczii, grown from seeds. Alonsoas
are half-hardy, and should be sown in May.
We think they might not do well in town gardens.</p>

<p>We must warn you that some people will be
very angry with us for advising you to grow
anything in lines. Lines are out of fashion, and
they certainly have been made to give hideous
effects by the ignorant gardener. But we make
bold to think that a child who wants a blaze of
colour all the summer in its small patch will get
what he wants if he grows his garden as contrary
Mary did, ‘all in a row.’ We will tell you now
about a charming little garden belonging to two
children in a London suburb. It is twelve feet
square, and has a gravel path up the centre,
with a tiled edge. At the back there is a seven-wall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
with a yellow Jasmine on one side
and a white one on the other. Both kinds do
well in town air, and the Yellow Jasmine comes
early in the spring, when flowers are scarce and
most welcome. The garden is shared by a brother
and sister, and the boy, who is eleven, has made
a seat against the wall of a four-foot plank, supported
by two logs, each eighteen inches high.
All through the summer the winter Jasmine is
covered by a perennial pink Bellbine, that dies in
autumn and comes up each spring. A pink ivy-leaved
Geranium and the blue Giant Convolvulus
climb up the wall too, and mix with the summer
(white) Jasmine, which flowers in masses. At
the side of each plot farthest from the path the
children grow white and pink Foxgloves from
seed, and the dwarf Sunflower Stella. In front
of these they have a pink monthly Rose, with a
Lavender bush on either side, and a bush of Lad’s
Love (Southernwood) on either side of the
Lavender. In May they put in a row of white
Marguerite Daisies; in front of these, clumps of
dark red Carnations (flowers that thrive in town
air), pink Geraniums, and pink Begonias, planted
in clumps of three. In the foreground they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
an edging of blue Lobelia. All through the
spring this little garden is gay with Narcissi and
Daffodils, on which the children spend about ten
shillings. The bedding plants cost about eight
shillings, and make the garden bright throughout
the summer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>ROSES</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Even</span> in a small garden there should be one or
two Roses, and as you may have to choose
yours from a long bewildering catalogue, we will
begin by telling you a little about the various
kinds suitable for a child’s garden.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hybrid Perpetuals.</span></h3>

<p>There are some splendid and celebrated Roses
in this class, but they have a shorter blooming
season than Roses that do not call themselves
perpetual. If, however, you live in the North,
you may find that you can grow the H.P.’s, as
Rose-growers call them, better than the more
delicate Tea Roses. Ulrich Brunner and Charles
Lefebvre are good old crimson ones, both fragrant.
Duke of Connaught and Duke of Edinburgh are
two of the best reds. Frau Karl Druschki is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
splendid white Rose, but it has no scent. General
Jacqueminot is another large crimson, so are
Charles Darwin and Alfred Colomb. Mrs. John
Laing is a soft pink. You must understand that
we are only giving you a few names in each class,
in case you are left to struggle unassisted with a
catalogue containing hundreds of names. If you
grow those we tell you of, you will have some
beautiful Roses; but so you will if anyone who
understands Roses chooses a different list for you.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tea Roses and Hybrid Teas.</span></h3>

<p>If you live in a mild climate and have a
sheltered corner for your garden, you should certainly
grow the Tea Roses and their Hybrids, as
they last in flower longer than the H.P.’s. Their
season is said to be from May till October, but in
a West of England garden we have gathered
perfect specimens on a south wall at Christmas.
Perhaps the best-known Tea Rose is the Gloire
de Dijon, an apricot yellow that can be grown
either as a bush rose or as a climber. Corallina
is a lovely bright pink; Madame Lambard is
bright rose; Maréchal Niel is the well-known
golden-yellow Rose grown so often under glass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
We should say that he and Niphetos, a beautiful
white Rose, are what some gardeners call ‘miffy
doers.’ If you don’t give them just exactly
what they like, they either die or look so ill and
reproachful that you cast them away. But if
you can please them, they are very beautiful.
So are Georges Nabonnand, a rosy white, shaded
with yellow, and Catherine Mermet, a light
flesh-coloured Rose of a globular shape.</p>

<p>Hybrid Teas are a cross between Teas and
Hybrid Perpetuals, and are considered stronger
than pure Teas. The best known of all is La
France, and we cannot think why any catalogue
should describe it as lilac. It is a rich pink, a
lovely globular shape, fragrant, and one of those
friendly Roses that flower from early summer
till the frosts come. Madame Abel Chatenay is
another Rose we recommend strongly. It is
carmine, with shades of salmon. La Tosca is
pink. Viscountess Folkestone is pale salmon,
globular, and fragrant. Boule de Neige is pure
white. Caroline Testout must not be omitted
even from such a small list as this. It is pinky-salmon,
large, globular, and fragrant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Climbing Roses.</span></h3>

<p>There are many varieties that will climb, and
we can only give you a few names of the most
vigorous and beautiful. The old-fashioned Aimée
Vibert is a white cluster Rose, very hardy and
free-flowering. It is a Noisette, a scented cluster
Rose; so is the William Allen Richardson, a
popular apricot-yellow Rose that we should not
choose, because its buds lose colour as they open.
Dorothy Perkins is a pink cluster Rose, a
Wichuriana; Lady Gay is a cherry-pink rambler;
and the Crimson Rambler itself is one of the
best climbers there is. The Waltham Rambler
is a delicate pink, a most lovely cluster Rose.
Alberic Barbier and Elisa Robichon are both
Wichurianas—little climbing Roses, with dark,
small, glossy leaves.</p>

<p>We think that you will only have room for
two or three Roses in your little garden, and that
you had better have either those we have already
told you of or some of the China Roses, also
called Bengal or Monthly. Even in the North
of England we have seen them in full flower
at the end of November. One of the best is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Cramoisie Supérieure, and you can have it either
as a bush Rose or as a climber. Another good one
is the common Blush, a pink Rose that may be
grown either as a dwarf or a climber. Little
Pet is a white cluster Rose, and very dwarf.
Mrs. Bosanquet is a pale flesh-coloured cluster
Rose.</p>

<p>In 1840 Mrs. Loudon said that there were
nearly 2,000 species and varieties of Roses. Even
the well-known garden Roses are divided into so
many groups that we cannot give you a complete
list of them. Where people have plenty of
room they grow the Penzance Briars, beautiful
hybrids raised by Lord Penzance. Their foliage
is as fragrant as Sweetbriar, and they have single
or semi-double flowers. A wild Japanese Rose,
Rosa Rugosa, makes a great bush that has glowing
orange and red berries, but it is not suitable for
a small garden. Then there are Moss Roses
(very sweet-scented), Cabbage or Provence Roses
(you find them in old-fashioned gardens), Scotch
Briars (small flowers and such thorns! but very
pretty), Austrian Briars, Banksia Roses, Damask
Roses, Gallica or Provins Roses (from Provins,
a small French town, and not to be confounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
with Provence), Multiflora or Polyantha Roses
(very small fairy Roses, that are having a vogue
just now). These are a few you will often hear
named, but you will find many more in any good
Rose-grower’s catalogue.</p>

<p>If you live in or near London, you will see
a great many Roses grown on standards. You
must decide for yourself whether you like them.
We prefer a Rose climbing, or as part of a
hedge or as a bush; but standard Roses are
very popular with some gardeners, and when
they are healthy they certainly carry a great
many flowers.</p>

<p>Roses like a good firm, rich soil, what gardeners
call ‘unctuous loam.’ It feels almost
greasy between the fingers, and many plants
love it. If your soil is light and dry, you must
dig in some farm manure and, if you can get
it, some clay before you plant Roses. If it is
a heavy, cold clay, you should add lime, sand,
and leaf-mould. In October the places for your
Roses should be well dug and dressed, as November
is the best month to plant. If you live
where there is danger of autumn frosts, you
should plant in the middle of October, or as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
early in November as possible. We are giving
you the general rule about Roses, but some
gardeners like to plant in March, when the
frosts are over. If you buy Roses in pots, you
can put them out at any time except during a
frost. In hot summer weather you would
naturally watch them at first, and give them
shade if they seemed to flag. When you put
a plant out of a pot, you must be careful not to
disturb its roots and to give it plenty of water.
If necessary, break the pot, as that would disturb
the Rose less than shaking and shoving it.
Go to a good firm for your Roses, and, if possible,
one that will sell you Roses on <i>their own
roots</i>. We are not going to tell you about
various grafted Roses, because we think that
while you are a child you will find them troublesome,
as they often send up shoots from the
wild briars on which the Rose you want has
been grafted; but we warn you that you will
not get Roses on their own roots unless you go
to one of the great Rose-growers.</p>

<p>When your Roses arrive, do not leave their
roots exposed to the air a moment. Cover them
with a sack or matting, and take a pail of water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
with you in which to dip each Rose as you plant
it. Then make a hole about a foot wide each
way, and just deep enough to allow you to
spread the fibrous roots out to left and right
of the stem. Hold the Rose in its place, and
work a quantity of fine earth amongst its roots;
and put the <i>collar</i>, the point at which the garden
rose is budded on to the briar, from one to three
inches below the surface. When you have put
enough earth, tread it firmly down, and tie the
Rose to a strong stake, so that the wind cannot
shake it and worry its roots while they are trying
to take hold of the soil. The best modern
growers do not approve of manure as a mulch in
winter. They say it does little or no good, and
they prefer a loose soil surface. Soot dusted
over the beds is beneficial, and so is a dressing
of basic slag in the autumn.</p>

<p>It is no use to try to grow Roses in complete
shade or where they will be choked by other
plants. The Queen of Flowers <i>will</i> have light
and air and some sun. She will let you set a
few dwarf Alpines, Violas, or Forget-me-nots
at her feet; but she will not be shouldered by
high, coarse-growing herbaceous plants, or by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
greedy shrubs. If your garden is not backed
by a wall where you could have a climbing Rose,
you might have an arch over your path. The
ready-made wire ones sold by ironmongers will
make all your fastidious friends shiver, and call
you a Philistine; but you will forget that when
summer comes, and it is hidden by flowers. Of
course, if you are a country child, and can get
the village carpenter to make you a wooden arch
of small straight Larches or other young tree-trunks,
you will prefer it to any wire construction.
The uprights must be set at least two feet
deep in the earth, and firmly bedded in with
stones. The horizontal piece must be secured
firmly to the uprights. You would have a lovely
arch if on one side you put Dorothy Perkins,
the pink cluster Rose, with the white Clematis,
Montana; while on the other side you might
set a vigorous white cluster Rose called Félicité
Perpétué, or Maids of the Village, with the well-known
purple Clematis, Jackmanni. The four
would twine and mix with each other on the
arch, and you would have flowers there from
May till September.</p>

<p>When you wish to gather your Roses—or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
indeed, any of your flowers—do it with scissors
or a sharp knife. It is most distressing to see
people violently tear off their flowers, and in
doing so probably disturb the plant’s roots. A
Rose should be cut so as to leave the flowering
shoot you will find just below it; otherwise you
cannot expect a succession of blooms. Always
pick off dead and faded flowers, and be on the
look-out for curled-up leaves that have a little
web of fluff in the centre. Underneath the fluff
there is or will be a caterpillar, who will live on
the foliage of your Roses if you do not destroy
him. You must also wage war on aphides,
which suck all the life out of the young shoots,
mildew, and red-rust.</p>

<p>You often find that there is some confusion
between spraying and syringeing plants, but you
ought to understand that the two processes are
different. A syringe can be bought for two or
three shillings, and if you cannot afford a proper
spray, you must use a syringe with your insecticides.
It distributes the water either through
a rose in tiny streams or in a single jet, and is
meant for washing plants. A good spraying
machine, such as the Abol, costs from eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
shillings upwards, and sends the liquid over the
plants in a vapour that does not run off.</p>

<p>Aphides, or green fly, can be kept down if
you spray them with tepid water in which you
have mixed a little soft-soap; but when you
have killed your aphides, you must syringe well
with clear water, as the soap would not be good
for your Roses. Another way is to boil an
ounce of quassia chips in a pint of water, and
when cold to add two gallons of rain-water;
then spray. Many people clean their Roses with
a double brush sold for the purpose, and called
an ‘aphis brush,’ but they have to be most careful
in using it not to injure the delicate young leaves
the green fly always chooses.</p>

<p>If mildew appears, it may mean that your soil
is badly drained or too wet for Rose-trees. It
looks like little white spots on the leaves. You
had better syringe or water your Roses, and while
they are wet dust with soot or flowers of sulphur.
In dry weather this dressing must be washed off
when it has been on the leaves a day or two.</p>

<p>Red-rust is a common disease that turns Rose-leaves
yellow before their time. Then they
shrivel and drop off, and when this goes on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
any great extent, it is both unsightly and
weakening to the tree. None of the paraffin
mixtures that used to be recommended for this
and other pests are now considered good for
roses. If you can have an Abol Spray you can
get a mixture called ‘Abol, White’s Superior,’
which is recommended by Miss Rose Kingsley in
her book ‘Roses and Rose-Growing.’ It is easy
to use, and efficacious against Green Fly and other
pests. If you have neither spray nor syringe, dust
a little flowers of sulphur on the leaves.</p>

<p>In summer an occasional dose of manure water
is a great help to Roses, but it must never be
given in dry weather unless a good soak of fresh
water is given first; otherwise the thirsty plants
would suck up the strong manure water too
greedily, and make themselves ill. We tell you
of this way to encourage your Roses in hot
weather, in case you belong to a garden where
you can get some manure water given. Otherwise
you had better use a little Clay’s Fertilizer
or some other artificial manure.</p>

<p>Except in very cold districts, Roses should be
pruned early in March. Tea Roses, however,
should wait till the first week in April. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
object of pruning is to induce the plant to make
new wood, but the amount to be done varies
greatly with the size and age of the Rose. Climbing
Roses need not be pruned at all, but in the
autumn any dead wood you see should be cut
out. On strong-growing bush Roses you may
leave six eyes on a stem; on weaker growths
three or four eyes. If you look at a Rose-tree
you will see what we mean by ‘eyes’ are the
little knots or buds on the stalks. With a sharp
knife you should slice off the upper part of the
stalk at a bud that faces <i>outwards</i>, because then
the new shoot will grow outwards, and make a
better-shaped tree. All brown, dead wood should
be cut away. There will be a great deal more
for you to learn about pruning when you are
older, either from books or from gardeners. We
have only told you one or two of the simplest
rules, so that in case you have no gardener or
gardening friend to help you, you should not let
your bush Roses grow quite wild.</p>

<p>If your Roses have been given you, they may
be on various stocks, and not on their own roots,
so we think we must tell you how to know when
it is the stock, and not the Rose, that is sending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
up its tiresome wild shoots. Most Hybrid Perpetuals,
Teas, and Hybrid Teas have five leaves,
but most ‘stocks’ have seven or nine leaves.
When you see these wild shoots coming up out
of the ground, you must cut them away, as
they are using food that should go to your
Roses. But never cut the shoots that come out
of the base of the Polyantha or the Rambler
Roses. These look very like suckers, but are the
flowering shoots of the following year.</p>

<p>You may just as well try to take a few cuttings
from your own Roses, and, if they will let
you, from other people’s, as if you could succeed
you would soon raise a stock ‘on their own
roots,’ and have no trouble with briars. August
is the proper month for this operation, and what
you will want is some silver sand, a sheltered
corner, and a sharp knife. A cutting should be
nine inches long, this year’s growth, hard and
woody, but not succulent. It should either be
cut straight across just below a joint, or torn
away with a little tag or heel. Try both ways.
All the leaves, as well as the tips, must be snipped
off. Then make a little trench, fill with silver
sand, and press your cuttings firmly in, letting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
them lie sideways rather than stand bolt upright.
If you have a hand-light for them, so much the
better, but they should strike without that provided
you do not let the soil about them get dry
or loose. The following year you will be able to
transplant them, but while they are young it is
advisable to pinch off their flowers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>CARNATIONS AND PINKS</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">You</span> can grow carnations near London, as they
do not mind some smoke and soot; but they are
most particular about soil and situation. A
damp, heavy, wet soil is poison to them, and
they do not like a hot, dry one. They want
good plant food, and will do best in a rich loam.
The natural way for Carnations to grow is on a
steep slope, with their heads hanging down. In
the Alps, where the single ones are found in a
wild state, their roots are tucked away amongst
the rocks, while a mass of flowers hangs over the
edge. The real use of the little green cup from
which the flower springs is to carry off water and
keep the centre of the flower dry and wholesome.
Our garden ones do well planted in pots and
boxes, and hanging from window-sills and
balconies. We do not often grow them so in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
England yet, but you may see splendid displays
in the South of France, in Spain, or in South
Germany. Carnations will stand more wind than
most plants; in fact, the most valuable receipt
for Carnation-growing is—‘Give them all the air
and sun possible.’ It is useless to put them in
shade, and if you have a wet clay soil you must
dig in a quantity of sand for them, or, better still,
mortar rubbish. Remember, too, that though
Clay’s Fertilizer and other patent manures are
useful on dry soils, they do more harm than good
on damp ones. Carnations do not like to come
into direct contact with farm or stable manure,
so if you use it you must have it buried at least
eighteen inches. When Carnations are growing
in your border they will need staking, and you
can, if you choose, use the spiral stakes that need
no tying. Another good way is to drive two
stakes into the ground, about fifteen inches apart,
one on either side of the plant, and a little in
front of it; then tie a piece of thick string
across them near the top and let the flower
sprays rest on it. This will keep them off the
ground, and is not as stiff-looking as a bunch
tied to a single stick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>There are three ways of increasing your stock
of Carnations: by layers, by pipings or cuttings,
and by seed. We will tell you first how to layer
them. If possible, it should be done in July, so
that your layers are well rooted and ready to
transplant in September. You must prepare
some finely sifted compost of loam, leaf-mould,
and silver sand. A town child may not be able
to get leaf-mould, but you can, at any rate, buy
a little silver sand, sift some of the best soil in
the garden, and mix the two together. This must
be placed round the Carnation you wish to layer,
and you must choose those plants which have
made good non-flowering shoots, neither too
woody nor too tender and sappy. The leaves of
each shoot must be stripped off at the end proceeding
from the main stalk, leaving about three
or four leafy joints above. Then with a sharp
knife you make an upward slit, beginning just
below a joint, and ending halfway through, so
as to form a tongue. The shoot must then be
carefully pegged down with a hairpin or a zinc
layer pin in such a way that the cut is left open
and the tongue is firmly fixed in the soil. A
little more soil should then be put over the part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
that is pegged down, and water given with a
fine rose. In a month or so the layers ought to
be rooted, and by the first or second week in
September they should be ready to detach from
the parent plant and plant out. It is a delicate
piece of work to make the layer cut, as if you do
not go far enough no roots result, while if you
go too far the layer dies. Nor is it easy to peg
down your layer successfully. But it is such
an interesting operation that we think you will
probably want to try it.</p>

<p>Cuttings should also be taken in July or
August, because the ground is warm then. One
way is to cut the stem square across a joint,
remove all the leaves for at least two inches from
the bottom, and plant in a situation that is shady
but not directly under trees. The cuttings
should be inserted at least two inches deep, and
in soil that has had sand well worked into it.
They must not be allowed to get quite dry.</p>

<p>Another kind of cutting we will describe from
that delightful old gardening book published by
John Murray in 1840, and called, ‘Gardening for
Ladies,’ by Mrs. Loudon. ‘Pipings are cuttings
of Pinks and Carnations, and, indeed, are applicable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to all plants having jointed tubular stems.
They are prepared by taking a shoot that has
nearly done growing, and holding the root end
of it in one hand, below a pair of leaves, and with
the other pulling the top part above the pair of
leaves, so as to separate it from the root part of
the stem at the socket formed by the axils of the
leaves, leaving the part pulled off with a tubular
or pipe-like termination—hence the name of
pipings; and when thus separated they are
inserted in finely sifted earth or sand, and a hand-glass
is firmly fixed over them.’</p>

<p>Most gardeners snip off the tips of the outer
leaves of pipings and cuttings, because then they
can see more easily when new leaves are forming.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Carnations from Seed.</span></h3>

<p>The most attractive way of increasing your
stock of Carnations is to grow them from seed.
In this way you get a great variety, and take a
sporting chance of raising a new specimen. But
you <i>must</i> buy your seed from a first-rate firm.
As it is rather expensive, you will wish to give
it every chance, so you must prepare the soil
carefully for your seed-pan or shallow box.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Whichever of these you use must have a few
holes in it, then some broken crocks for drainage,
and then the compost made of leaf-mould, loam,
and silver sand. This mixture should be moist
when you use it, as then you will not have to
water much. The seed of Carnations is big
enough for you to plant one by one with the
point of a knife if you have a little patience.
When this is done, take a little fine soil between
your hands and sift it evenly and lightly over
your seeds. Then cover with a glass, and, if you
can, place in a frame or greenhouse. If you
have neither, you must make shift with a sunny
window as long as there is danger of frost; but
we must warn you that it is not easy to raise
seeds in a room. Even in an unused one they
are likely to be too damp, or too dry, or to grow
spindly in their effort to reach the light. March,
April, and May are all months when gardeners
sow Carnation seed, and by the end of May you
might set your pan out of doors if you can keep
slugs from it. In ten days or a fortnight the
seedlings should appear, and then you must face
the fact that the biggest and strongest—those
about which you feel most triumphant—will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the single ones, while the poor little weaklings
will give you the best double flowers. All
should be pricked off when they have four real
leaves, either into boxes or pans or into the open
ground. If you have raised your seed under
glass in March, you must keep your pricked-out
seedlings in a frame or greenhouse till all danger
of frost is over. When you have neither, you
must do the best you can with a room. The
important thing is to keep away frost at this
early stage. Be careful, when your Carnations
are in the open ground, to keep away slugs with
soot or lime, and look out for Leather-jackets
and Wire-worms, both fatal to Carnations.
The Leather-jacket is the larva of the Daddy-long-legs,
and in this state has no legs at all.
In spite of this, they can get along as fast as
they wish. They are slaty-brown in colour,
and look like short, fat, lifeless grubs. Wire-worms
have yellow bodies, brown heads, and
three pairs of legs behind their head. Both these
pests may be trapped by burying small pieces
of raw potato, carrot, or turnip, beneath the
soil, with skewers through to mark where
they are. These traps should be examined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
every morning. Another way to catch Leather-jackets,
or Chop-worms, is to put pieces of
slate, wood, brick, or turf on the ground, as they
creep under such things for shelter. Rust, Spot,
Eel-worm, and the Carnation Maggot are also
enemies that do much damage. The two first
are fungi, and the best way to avoid them is
to give your plants sun and air. The Eel-worm
produces a disease called gout, and no remedy is
known for it. The Carnation Maggot can be
dug out of the heart of a plant with a needle.
We hope we shall not have discouraged you by
telling you a few of the forty-nine ills the Carnation
is heir to. They are not really difficult
plants to keep alive if you can give them plenty
of air and the right soil. You must either increase
your own stock every year or buy new
ones. The same plant will go on for several
years in favourable conditions, but you cannot
depend on many doing this.</p>

<p>Some of your Carnation seedlings are sure to
be single, and they would look very pretty on a
rockery or hanging from a wall or a window-sill.
We have not said anything about the different
classes in which florists divide Carnations and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Picotees, because we do not think you need
specialize in this way till you are grown up.
Perhaps even then you will agree with us and
admire many a seedling that the hidebound
fancier would consign to the dustheap. The
old Clove, that most attractive of Carnations,
will do well on a sandy soil, but dies out in cold,
wet seasons.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pinks.</span></h3>

<p>For an edging there is nothing to equal a good
fringed white Pink. We have seen the little
old-fashioned one doing well in the Pensioners’
Gardens at Chelsea Hospital, and one of the
authors has grown masses of Mrs. Sinkins six
miles from Charing Cross. They want an open
border and ordinary well-dug garden soil. In
times of drought, and on very hot, dry soils, they
want water from April on until they flower;
but in most districts they look after themselves
in this respect. When the clumps are more than
a year old, we have seen a good gardener give
each one a liberal dressing of fresh soil in early
spring, so that it should not feel starved. This
was done without disturbing the roots by coaxing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the soil under and amongst the shoots. Pinks
can be divided quite early in the spring, or after
flowering, or they can be increased, like Carnations,
by layers, pipings, or cuttings. When you
divide plants always choose showery weather, and
dig the hole for each portion of your plant so deep
that the roots are not bruised and crammed. When
gardeners divide Pinks, they replant them deep,
and with the leaves rather bunched together.
The habit of the Pink is to spread itself on the
surface of the soil, with its stalks uncomfortably
exposed, and in the course of the summer you
will see each clump coming back to its untidy
ways.</p>

<p>We agree with Mrs. Ewing, who said that
some gardeners had witchcraft in their hands,
and could make anything grow and flourish.
We have seen one of this kind transplant a
Crimson Rambler on a hot July day, and the Rose
liked it. We used to see the same one divide
her Pinks, and make every bit take root and
increase. But as you may not be a born witch
or wizard, and as you may find layers, pipings,
and cuttings all difficult operations, we will tell
you the easiest way in the world to increase your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Pinks. We came across it in <i>Gardening Illustrated</i>,
in one of those little narratives of real
personal experience that make a good gardening
paper so useful and interesting. The writer said
that all he did was to <i>tear</i> off strong young shoots
with a good heel or tag attached, trim off the
lower leaves, and plant firmly in a partially shaded
situation and in sandy soil. We have tried this
plan ourselves, and have found that every slip we
took grew. We take them when our Pinks have
quite done flowering. The following year we
plant them out, and they flower a little, and by
the second year they are good strong clumps.
But you will probably not find this way answers if
you have a cold, heavy soil.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>LILIES</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> will begin with Lilium Candidum, the Madonna
or Cottage Lily. You know it, of course:
the big white lily that the Madonna, and sometimes
the angels, carry in old pictures, and that you see
at its best in cottage gardens. All gardeners ask
each other ‘Why do we see great healthy clumps
of this lovely Lily in poor little neglected cottage
gardens, while in our highly-fed and carefully-tended
ones it gets the now well-known Lily
disease?’ We hope your Madonna Lilies will not
get it, because it is rather heart-breaking to watch
its ravages. In the spring you see fine, healthy
leaves, and you look forward to the tall stems
that will arise from them and bear great scented,
shining white flowers. But one day you notice
that the leaves look rather brown. A stem has
shot up, but the leaves on it look brown, too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Every day it seems to get browner and flabbier,
and at last you cut it down because it is so
unsightly. Sometimes these sick stems bear
sick, half-decayed Lilies, but they give you no
pleasure. A healthy Dandelion is far more
beautiful.</p>

<p>One of the best amateur gardeners we ever
knew used to say that there were some plants
that throve on neglect, and we really believe that
the Madonna Lily is one of them. The cottager
who puts some healthy bulbs in dry soil, and leaves
them there year after year, gets better flowers
than the gardener who fusses and feeds them.
There seems to be no doubt that the Lily disease
has its best chance in a low, badly drained soil
that holds moisture. If you can give your Lilies
a dry, well-drained position, you will probably
succeed with them. Buy your bulbs from a good
firm, dust them well with flower of sulphur,
plant them about five inches deep and nine inches
apart in sand, and then never interfere with them
again. Remember that their flowers will last
longer if not exposed to the full midday sun,
but do not plant them near the roots of the
trees, or where rain cannot reach them. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
require rain, but not stagnant moisture. Three
bulbs together make a nice clump, and they
would look well in the centre of your border.
The leaves die down in winter, and when the
new ones come in spring, you must look out for
slugs. If you have many, surround your Lilies
with lime, soot, or wood ashes. Mr. J. Weathers
says that a frequent fine syringeing with warm
soapy water will sometimes check the disease.
If when your Lilies flower you do not want their
petals dusted over with yellow pollen, you must
remove the anthers, the part of the stamen that
contains the pollen.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Orange Lily</span> (<span class="smcap">Lilium Croceum</span>).</h3>

<p>This is the splendid orange Lily with purple
spots so much grown in Irish cottage gardens.
It is one of the easiest and hardiest of Lilies, and
looks well against a background of shrubs or ferns.
The bulbs should be planted from six to nine
inches deep, and need not be disturbed for years.
If you have to dig yours up in spring or autumn,
you can increase your stock by carefully detaching
the little offsets from the parent bulbs. In
time they will make flowering plants. This Lily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
will grow in sunshine or shade, and in any healthy
garden soil.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 453px;">
<img src="images/i_174.jpg" width="453" height="600" alt="girl looking at lilies that are taller than she is" />
<div class="caption">LILIES AND ROSES.</div>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Martagon, or Turk’s Cap, Lilies.</span></h3>

<p>Some Lilies make two kinds of roots—one kind
from their base, and one kind from their stem.
Others only make basal roots, and should, on that
account, be planted in autumn. Their root action
begins in October, and goes on through the
winter, so that if they are lifted in spring they
are seriously damaged, and may not flower. All
the Martagon, or Turk’s Cap, Lilies, belong to this
class. If you want them you must plant them
in autumn. You can have them in crimson,
white, or yellow, but the handsomest is Album,
with stems from four to five feet high, carrying a
large number of waxy white flowers. The petals
in this species are turned back, and give the effect
of a Turk’s cap or turban. They are easily
grown in a mixture of loam and leaf-mould, and
in a partly shaded position.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lilium Speciosum.</span></h3>

<p>There are several varieties of this Lily, and
they are all most beautiful. They flower in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
late summer and autumn, and should have a
warm and sheltered situation. They should be
planted in loam, peat, leaf-mould, and sharp
sand. If you live in a cold district, you should
give these Lilies and the Auratums a covering
in winter. A mulching of manure is good for
them, and will keep them warm.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tiger Lily</span> (<span class="smcap">Lilium Tigrinum</span>).</h3>

<p>The best variety of this Lily is Lilium Tigrinum
Splendens. The flowers are orange-red, spotted
or ‘tigered’ with blackish purple. A fine specimen
sometimes reaches a height of seven feet, and
bears twenty-five flowers. All the Tiger Lilies
are easily grown in a well-drained soil in a
partly shaded situation. They can be increased
by offsets, or by the little blackish bulblets you
will see on the stems amongst the leaves. These
will drop and root themselves if not gathered,
but they will not make flowering bulbs for some
years.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lilium Auratum.</span></h3>

<p>This is the King of Lilies, the ‘Golden Lily of
Japan,’ and a native of that country. If you live
within reach of Kew Gardens, you should go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
there in summer on purpose to see these splendid
Lilies flowering amongst the Rhododendrons,
where they have a moist, peaty soil for their roots.
Mr. Wallace, of Colchester, the great authority
on Lilies, says that the Auratum likes a strong
soil, not too heavy, a good friable loam. It
should be planted about three times its own
depth, and, if you can possibly get it, in some
moist sea-sand. It is one of the stem-rooting
Lilies, and will sometimes get support through its
flowering season from these roots only. But if it
is to make good bulb growth, too, so as to come
up and flower another year, it must have basal
roots, and be planted directly it arrives from
Japan. It requires a warm and sheltered situation,
and in spring likes a mulching of well-rotted
manure. Do not put it where it can be shaken
by violent winds or scorched by a full midday
sun. The best variety is Auratum Platyphyllum.
There is one thing you must remember about all
Lilies, and that is that they sometimes lie dormant
for a year. We have often found they did this
after removal. We once planned a fine display
of the Madonna Lily in a corner of a new border,
but though we bought dozens of bulbs and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
them in, none came up. We thought they must
have resented the move and died; but when we
grubbed down amongst them to see what had
happened, we found every bulb as plump and
healthy as we could wish. They were having a
year’s sleep.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Day Lily</span> (<span class="smcap">Hemerocallis</span>).</h3>

<p>This belongs to the Lily Order, but it is not a
bulb. It is a herbaceous plant, with a rhizome
and short, fleshy roots, rather like a bunch of
brownish-white fingers. They succeed in any
good garden soil, but they like one that has been
well manured some weeks before planting. They
should be left undisturbed three or four years,
and may then be divided in autumn when the
leaves have withered. When you replant, put
them from twelve to eighteen inches apart. The
flowers are yellow or tawny, and only last for a
day, or at most two. But they succeed each
other quickly for several weeks. The Greek
name means ‘Beauty of a day.’</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lily of the Valley</span> (<span class="smcap">Convallaria Majalis</span>).</h3>

<p>There is a popular idea that the Lily of the
Valley will grow in any kind of deep shade, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
so you see its poor, starved leaves struggling for
life under evergreen shrubs, or the strong roots
of trees that steal all its nourishment. The Lily
of the Valley does like shade for the greater
part of the day, but it is a plant that requires
proper food. It will stand sun if you give it a
deep, rich soil. The best situation for it is under
a wall with a north or west aspect, or in any
shady place that has good soil with some sand in
it, and fresh air overhead. The bed should be
made in October, and the little tuberous roots
set two inches apart each way, with the point of
the crown just under the soil. Work the soil
well amongst and over the branching roots as you
plant. In a cold climate protect the bed with
bracken or dead leaves in winter, or, better still,
with a covering of manure. After four years
your Lilies of the Valley should have grown into
a thick mat of leaves. Then in October you
must dig them up, dress your bed with fresh
manure, soil and sand, pull your plants apart, and
set them in rows again. If you can make two
beds, one in sun and one in shade, you will have
a longer succession of bloom. When you gather
the flowers, do not pick many leaves, and, at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
rate, only one from each plant, as they nourish
the crowns.</p>

<p>There is a pretty story of the way the Lily
of the Valley came to run wild, as it does in
German woods. Once upon a time, so long ago
that no one in Germany had any Lilies of the
Valley, there lived an Abbot who was a great
gardener and a holy man. A pilgrim passing
through his district was kindly received by him,
and in gratitude gave him a withered-looking
root that he said he had brought from a country
where similar roots bore lovely scented flowers.
The Abbot planted it and watched it, as he
watched everything in his garden. In the spring
the root sent up a few broad, shining leaves, but
no flowers. He left it alone, and next year there
were more leaves and two or three Lilies of the
Valley, the first that had ever grown in Germany.
By the third year the fame of the plant had
travelled here and there, so that people who loved
their gardens came to the Abbey on purpose
to see it. Every year there was a bigger bed of
the Lilies and a longer procession of visitors
to see them, and the heart of the Abbot was
filled with pride and vainglory, because he, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
no other man, possessed the flowers. But he was
a holy Abbot; he became afraid of the pride
growing within him, and saw it to be evil. So
one day he dug up every Lily of the Valley
growing in his garden and carried them into the
woods, and planted them here and there, that
they might belong to all men, and not to him
alone; and ever since the woods of Germany
have been full of Lilies of the Valley.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>ROCK AND WALL GARDENS</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> very worst advice we ever saw given about
gardening was given in a popular magazine in an
article on Rock Gardens. It said that all you
wanted for a rockery in a town or suburban
garden was a cartload of stones or <i>bricks</i> dumped
down in a corner. We really wondered when
we read it whether the writer thought that plants
could feed on bricks. Soon after reading this
nightmare of an article we came across Mrs.
Swanwick’s clever book, ‘The Small Town
Garden,’ and we will tell you what she says about
the proper way to start a rockery. ‘If people
who make a rockery would consider that it is to
be made of earth, supported with stones or rocks,
they would be much nearer the right method
than those who think of a rockery as a pile
of stones with a little soil dribbled in among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
them. If we bear these requirements in mind, it
becomes clear that the stones or rocks must be
set so as to leave no hollows empty of soil between
them, nor niches kept dry by overhanging rocks,
and the slope of the earth must be such that the
rain will not wash it away, and expose the roots
of the plants.’</p>

<p>It may be that a flat, sunny border cannot be
spared for you, but that if you choose you may
annex a grass-grown bank or slope of a hill going
up to a stone wall or to shrubs. We will tell
you how we once saw a place of this kind made
into a charming rock garden with some blocks of
limestone and a few days’ labour. The bank in
this case led from an upper lawn to a lower one,
and had a south aspect. The turf was all removed,
the soil was thoroughly broken and mixed
with sand, and then slabs of limestone were
mixed into it, each one with a slight upward tilt,
so as to hold the earth and catch the rain. The
great point to remember about rock gardening is
that every stone or rock should be wedged into
the soil a little slantwise, so that the hidden end
slants down and the end you see slants up. You
soon find out an elementary truth of this kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
for yourself if you try to grow things in a badly-made
wall or rockery. We once watched someone
struggle with a loosely built granite wall that
tilted a little towards him, and which had no soil
in its crevices. He tried stuffing in earth, but as
the slant was wrong it fell out as it dried. No
rain reached the roots of his plants because the
top stones sheltered the lower ones, so nothing
that needed moisture would live. Perhaps in
the course of years he might have coaxed some
of the house-leeks to find a lodging there; but as
he wanted a wall garden clothed in spring with
hanging sheets of flowering plants, the only way
was to pull the wall down and build it properly.
Then it had earth packed into every crevice, and
the stones so arranged that the rain could reach
every plant set amongst them. Some plants, it
is true, will live on next to nothing, but there
are very few that will do without rain and will
survive when their roots have reached a hollow
place amongst stones.</p>

<p>We think that while you are a child you will
probably not have much chance either of making
rock gardens or of building walls; but you may
have a bit of wall or garden that easily lends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
itself to rock plants, and would not do well for
anything else. In some parts of England you
may have a garden that is rock with a sprinkling
of soil on it, and the difficulty will be to find or
make places for vegetables and deep-rooted shrubs
and flowers. In a garden of this kind the children
are quite likely to have a patch where the rocks
are showing through the soil, and where it is
difficult to find pockets of earth deep enough
even for Daffodils or Tulips. But there are
many beautiful shallow-rooted plants you can
grow in such places as these, for they will not
be like the silly heap of loose stones or bricks
described in the magazine article. For instance,
if you put a bit of the Arenaria Balearica
in such a rocky corner as this, it will find
its way here and there, clothing every stone
with a mossy carpet, and in spring putting out
thousands of tiny white starry flowers. Then
there is a charming Dwarf Veronica (<i>Veronica
repens</i>), that seems content with very little soil,
increases at a great rate, and has that pretty
way of clothing the stones and taking their
shapes. Another of our favourite common
Alpines is the Campanula Cæspitosa, a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Campanula that sends up its quivering white or
blue bells the whole summer through. It is so
hardy and rambling, and increases so fast, that
the fastidious rock gardener warns you not to let
anything precious grow near it.</p>

<p>You will have to find out for yourself which
rock plants are so greedy and pushing that you
get tired of their company; for this must depend
on your soil and climate. In Cornwall the little
Arenaria Balearica spreads so quickly that you
soon tear it up by the yard, while in the North
of England it seems to increase slowly. In a
cold district you may be glad of things that
would overrun you in a warm one. Near a town
people grow whatever will best endure the soot
and close air. When you are older you will have
to find out which plants want lime and which
granite, which peat and which sand; but we will
only tell you of plants now that will grow in any
ordinary good garden soil mixed with a little leaf-mould
and some small stones, and we will only
give you the names of plants that can be got at
any good nursery garden. If you can do so, get
your plants in little pots, and put them into your
rockery or your wall on a showery spring day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
But take care that every plant has a good deep
pocket of fresh soil to feed it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Plants for a Rock Garden.</span></h3>

<p><i>Alyssum Saxatile.</i>—This grows into a dwarf
shrub in time, and is a mass of small, brilliant,
yellow flowers in spring. It is very sweet, and
the bees love it. It looks well near Aubrietias,
or near Lithospermum Prostratum. Suitable
either for a rock garden or for a loose stone
wall in which you can have a deep pocket of
earth for its roots.</p>

<p><i>Antirrhinums</i> (<i>Snapdragons</i>).—We think the
good dwarf ones are charming on rockeries. We
once had some pink ones grown from Sutton’s
seed that were as pretty as little Rose-bushes.
On walls some of the taller ones often look well,
and when they are self-sown they seem to flourish
in chinks where there cannot be much food for
them. If you have a wall you should sow a little
seed, and be careful not to mistake the seedlings
for weeds.</p>

<p><i>Anthericum Liliastrum</i> (<i>St. Bruno’s Lily</i>).—A
charming plant, growing from one to two feet
high, and flowering in May or June. It likes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
sandy loam. If you want to increase it, you can
divide it in the autumn.</p>

<p><i>Arabis.</i>—If you are a London child, you will
have seen this with London Pride in every London
rock garden. It is the commonest of rock
plants, and its white flowers make a pleasant
show near Aubrietias and Alyssum in spring.</p>

<p><i>Arenaria Balearica.</i>—This is the little creeping
mossy plant we have told you of already. Put a
bit on some soil near any stones you want covered.</p>

<p><i>Aubrietias.</i>—You must know these if you have
ever looked at a garden in spring. They are in
various shades of mauve and purple, and make
great sheets of colour on walls and rockeries.
It is sometimes called Purple Rock-Cress. You
can divide them in autumn, or you can grow
them from seed sown in May or June.</p>

<p><i>Campanulas.</i>—There are many varieties of
blue and white Harebells that do well on walls
and rockeries. Pumila, Pulla, and Cæspitosa
are three well-known dwarf ones. Isophylla is a
good hanging one, but not quite hardy. Persicifolia
is an easily-grown tall one. They are
increased by division.</p>

<p><i>Helianthemums, or Sun Roses.</i>—These must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
not be confused with the Cistus, or Rock Roses,
which are charming, but not so hardy as the
Helianthemums. If you grow them from seed
sown in May or June, you should in the following
year have a number of dwarf shrubs bearing
single flowers in a variety of shades, ranging
from white and yellow to bright crimson.</p>

<p><i>Iberis Sempervirens</i> is often called Perennial
Candytuft. We have known people buy it by
its Latin name, and be much disappointed to
find it was the well-known white flower they
had seen in all their friends’ gardens. It is not
proud, and will grow almost anywhere.</p>

<p><i>Iris Pumila and Iris Stylosa.</i>—We mention
two out of the many beautiful Irises suitable for
a rockery. Try to get the variety of Pumila
called Cœrulea, a lovely sky-blue. Stylosa is
the scented Iris that flowers in winter. It likes
sun and shelter, and dry, hard ground. It must
be manured.</p>

<p><i>Lithospermum Prostratum.</i>—If we were only
allowed one rock plant out of all there are, we
would choose this one. It flowers nearly all the
year round in some parts of England, and its
blue is as vivid as the blue of a Gentian. If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
can plant it so that its roots can tuck themselves
under a big rock as they grow, so much the
better. We have transplanted a big plant of it
successfully, but we did it in fear and trembling,
as it is said to hate disturbance. You had better
not try to divide it. It can only be increased by
cuttings, and they are not at all easy to strike.</p>

<p><i>Phlox Setacea.</i>—This is one of several varieties
of dwarf Phloxes that are useful for edgings and
rockeries. They must have sun and well-drained
soil, or they damp off.</p>

<p><i>Speedwell: Veronica Repens.</i>—There are many
varieties and sizes of Veronica. Some make big
garden shrubs. The one we recommend here is
a tiny trailing plant, with small pale blue flowers.
It increases at a great rate, and is easily divided.
Slugs like it, but do not make headway against
it in many gardens. It makes a pretty dwarf
edging amongst stones, as it creeps amongst
them, and partly covers them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 471px;">
<img src="images/i_191.jpg" width="471" height="600" alt="boy and girl working on rock garden next to stone-laid road" />
<div class="caption">“THE ROAD TO ROME.”</div>
</div>

<p><i>The Sedums, Saxifrages, and House-leeks, or
Sempervivums</i>, are all suitable for rockeries.
Some kinds of Sedums, or Stonecrops, grow wild
in our hedges. You should get Sedum Spectabile,
the Japanese Stonecrop, which bears large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
heads of pink flowers in August. There are
many widely differing varieties of Saxifrage, or
Rockfoil; for instance, Muscoides, the Mossy
Saxifrage, makes a plump, low cushion of green
moss on your rockery; Sarmentosa is the well-known
weed, Mother of Thousands; Umbrosa
is London Pride. Some have large leaves and
pink flowers; some send up pyramids of white
flowers from tufts of silvery leaves. You must
grow one or two at a time, and get to know
them by degrees. Sempervivums are those little
green rosettes you see spreading in clumps on
old roofs and walls. One of the most fascinating
is Sempervivum Arachnoideum, the Cobweb
House-leek. It covers itself with a curious white
down that looks like a spider’s web. They like
a dry sandy part of the rock garden, and full
exposure to the sun.</p>

<p>Besides these plants, you should put a few
bulbs in your rockery. Some of the very small
Daffodils, Narcissus Minimus or Bulbocodium
look charming coming up through a mossy carpet
of Arenaria Balearica, for instance. You could
also have some Snowdrops, some Siberian Squills,
some autumn Crocuses, some Fritillaries, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
some Dog’s Tooth Violets (Erythronium Dens
Canis). We much prefer the English names for
flowers, but it is often necessary to give both, so
that you should recognize it in the catalogues.
We heard of someone who sent to the other end
of England for a plant advertised as Tussilago
Fragrans, or the Winter Heliotrope, and she
was much disappointed to receive a bit of the
common Coltsfoot, that was an obnoxious weed
in her own garden. Someone else sent for Hieracium
Aurantiacum, which certainly sounds a first-class
name; but she did not want a bit of the
orange Hawkweed, as it had established itself
more firmly than she wished in her rock garden
already, and had to be kept in bounds with a
spade.</p>

<p>We have not given you separate lists for a
sunny and a shady rock garden, because we shall
tell you a little in another chapter about plants
that like shade. You must have some Primroses,
Polyanthuses, and Auriculas on your
rockery, and though they like the sun in spring,
the more delicate kinds need some shelter from
the hot summer sun. Try to get Primula rosea,
the hardy rose-coloured Himalayan Primrose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and Primula Cashmeriana, a Primrose that sends
up heads of mauve flowers on a fat stalk. Both
need much moisture. Then, the Japanese Primroses
are very handsome, and seed themselves
when once established; and Sieboldi, with its
many varieties, is easily increased, either by
seed sown in spring or by division of the roots.</p>

<p>Now we have chosen just a few flowers for
your rock garden, and with every word we write
others come and look at us reproachfully, saying,
‘Why are we left out?’ We see neat little tufts of
Thrift, or Sea-pink, and hanging sheets of white-flowered
Cerastium, Anemones of sorts, Alpine
Violas, Forget-me-nots, Hepaticas, Gentians, the
finer Columbines, and shrubs of various kinds
and sizes. But we have only had one aim in
writing this chapter, and that was to lead you
just one step towards the rock garden you must
make for yourself when you are older. Then
you must get yourself ‘Wall and Water Gardens,’
by Gertrude Jekyll, and ‘My Rock Garden,’
by Reginald Farrar, two books that will
teach you all that books can about this most
fascinating side of garden craft. But from the
first one we should like to quote a short passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
that tells you how a wise gardener supplements
what he learns from books by his own qualities
of patience and observation.</p>

<p>‘Nothing is a better lesson in the knowledge
of plants,’ says Miss Jekyll, ‘than to sit down in
front of them, and handle them, and look them
over just as carefully as possible; and in no way
can such study be more pleasantly or conveniently
carried on than by taking a light seat to the rock
wall and giving plenty of time to each kind of
little plant, examining it closely, and asking oneself
and it, Why this? and Why that? especially
if the first glance show two tufts, one with
a better appearance than the other; not to stir
from the place until one has found out why and
how it is done, and all about it. Of course a
friend who has already gone through it all can
help on the lesson more quickly, but I doubt
whether it is not best to do it all for oneself.’</p>

<p>That is excellent gardening advice, and you can
apply it to whatever you are trying to do, whether
it is a rock wall or a patch of Mustard and Cress.</p>

<p>We must end this chapter with a short list of
things we hope you will never allow in your
rock garden, and as they are all to be seen here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and there, you need not say that the advice is
unnecessary. Coloured glass balls, for instance!
We assure you that, especially in Germany, there
are many people who think coloured glass balls
beautiful objects in a garden. Others like bits
of quartz, and in cottage gardens you may see
sea-shells and broken glass. Then, persons who
ought to know better will make a grimy erection
with clinkers or broken bricks, and a home for
Slugs and Woodlice with a rotting tree-stump.
You must do none of these things. If you live
where you can easily get stone, have a rock
garden in some form, even if it is only an edging
of stones to your herbaceous border, and grow
some of the plants we have told you of amongst
them. If you live where your walls are of brick,
you may still get some plants established on them.
For instance, where weeds have established themselves,
you can remove them, stuff in a little
good soil, and sow a few seeds of Snapdragon or
Wallflower. Old brick walls make beautiful
wall-gardens, and when the builder is not looking
you can help on the process in a new one with a
chisel, a little fine moist soil, and a few roots or
seeds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>DIFFICULT AND SHADY GARDENS</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">As</span> we told you in our first chapter, the worst
piece of ground you can have for a garden is one
already occupied by the roots of trees and coarse-growing
shrubs or hedges. All around London
Privet hedges and grimy Laurels are to be seen
everywhere, and wherever people try to grow
flowers near their thievish roots the flowers
languish. You may put a few Crocuses in front
of a group of Laurels, but you will not get much
else to flourish. Even that hardiest of Saxifrages,
London Pride, leads a starved life, and
you cannot know how beautiful it is until you
have seen it sending up masses of its foamy pink
flowers in good air and from good soil. If you
not only have an impoverished and shady garden,
but one under the drip of trees, you will not
be able to do much with it. Still, we can tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
you about a few things we persuaded to live in a
situation of this kind not far from London. You
must understand that the two authors of this
book have had very different gardening experiences.
One is the mistress of a large and very
beautiful garden running down to the sea in the
West of England, while the other has been a
wanderer on the face of the earth, and has
worked in many gardens of varying sizes. It
is usually her fate to find a wilderness, delve like
Adam in it till it is a garden, and then go her
ways to the next wilderness. The one you are
to hear of now was not a pleasant country
wilderness, where even the Briars and Nettles are
growing in good clean soil and in fresh air. It
was one of those disheartening builders’ gardens,
where the earth looks a sort of unwholesome
lumpy drab, and is full of old bricks and ginger-beer
bottles. One side of it was bounded by a
Privet hedge, and the soil was starved, but as
it was sunny, we got the strong herbaceous
things and pinks to do well in it. The other
side, which was under great Horse-Chestnuts
and Laburnums, got no sun at all, looked very
bare, and was evidently wretched soil. We had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
it well dug and dressed, and planted clumps of
Michaelmas Daisy, of Iris Germanica, and of the
common Evening Primrose a little way back.
The Michaelmas Daisies soon made big bushes,
and did very well. The Evening Primroses
flowered, but ran up rather tall and spindly.
The Iris did not flower well, but it increased,
and made a clump of handsome leaves. In
front we found that the Perennial Candytuft
(Iberis Sempervirens) did well, and increased
quickly. You can hardly have a more satisfactory
plant for the front of a border of this
kind. Crocuses came up year after year, too,
but we never persuaded our Daffodils to flower
more than once in this garden. Annuals we
advise you strongly not to try. They are a
source of disappointment in such circumstances.
The pretty little yellow-flowered shrub St.
John’s Wort should do well under trees, and
so will some hardy Ferns.</p>

<p>If your garden is in the country, and is only
partly shaded by trees, you can grow many
beautiful things in it. Perhaps you will be able
to have a background of large stones, and plant
Ferns amongst them. The hardiest Ferns are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Male Fern, Osmunda, Hart’s Tongue, Spleen
Wort, Lady Fern, and Shield Fern, and these
all like shade. Amongst the Ferns you should
have Solomon’s Seal, Columbines, and Foxgloves.
As far as you can, in a garden of this
kind plant big patches of one flower, and not
a muddle of single specimens. Have a bed of
Lilies of the Valley in some part of it, and under
the trees a bed of Wild Hyacinths. Snowdrops
do well amongst the roots of shrubs and trees, so
well that in some gardens they spread and increase
like a wild flower. They are fond of peat.
Primroses do well in shady places, and so does
the Wood Anemone (Anemone Nemorosa). Periwinkle
will flower in shade, though it likes sun
part of the day. Many Saxifrages and Sempervivums
(Rockfoils and Stonecrops) will do well
in shady places. For instance, if you have a
stone edging to your border, you will be able to
have clumps of the mossy Saxifrages and of
various Stonecrops. Between them the little
dwarf Campanulas would do well, and give you
colour all through the summer months. The
splendid tall Campanula Pyramidalis might do
farther back near your Ferns, if you can give it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
good soil; so would Campanula Persicifolia,
which grows wild in Yorkshire woods. Many
Lilies like partial shade and to be near shrubs,
but they should never be planted close to the
roots of trees.</p>

<p>It is not as generally known as it should be
that nearly all the Cyclamens are hardy. The
Persian Cyclamen, that we know so well as a
pot plant and in greenhouses, is not hardy, and
you must not try that in your garden. Get
some of the other species which you will find
offered in any good bulb catalogue, and in winter
give them a covering of moss or dry leaves.
They like a dry, porous soil, mixed with a little
peat or leaf-mould and some lime or old mortar.
The corms are often half out of the ground, or
at any rate level with it; but some gardeners,
who have paid great attention to their culture,
prefer to bury them just under the soil, because
the roots of some species come from the top of
the corm. The one thing Cyclamens will not
stand is stagnant moisture. You must give
them well-drained, sandy soil, mixed with a little
lime. We repeat this because it is so important,
and because Cyclamens are so beautiful that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
are worth any trouble you can take for them.
Some flower in spring and some in autumn, and
they must be planted when they are at rest:
the spring ones in October or November, and
the autumn ones in June. If they flourish with
you their seedlings will appear naturally; otherwise
you had better buy new corms when you
want them. Gardeners raise them from seed,
but this requires a frame or gentle heat.</p>

<p>In a mild climate you can grow Hydrangeas
and the shrubby Veronicas in shady places, but
they will not live through prolonged hard frosts.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>SOME HARDY CLIMBERS</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> think the American who described climbing
plants as ‘creepers and crawlers’ must have been
first cousin to the American novelist who said
the house in which his heroine lived was not disfigured
by any messy plants growing near it. As
you may have a wall, a paling, an arch, or the
dead stump of a tree that you would like to disfigure
with flowers all the summer, we will tell
you of a few good hardy climbers, other than
those already recommended in earlier chapters.</p>

<p>A creeper should always be allowed to grow as
naturally as possible, and not be restrained more
than is necessary by nails or by cutting back.
Climbing Roses lose much of their vigour and
beauty if penned severely and stretched out tight
on a wall. Most climbing plants need some
support at the beginning, but later in life take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
care of themselves. One climber may be freely
allowed to mingle with others, so that you can
think out lovely combinations; but you must
understand which are free growers and which are
shy and delicate, or the strong will strangle the
weak. The common Honeysuckle and a pink
monthly Rose climb all over the front of a
cottage known to us, and on the south side
the exquisite Solanum Jasminoides throws its
clusters of snowy flowers into them. The Honeysuckle
and the monthly Rose would grow almost
anywhere in these islands, but the Solanum Jasminoides,
or Winter Nightshade, is only hardy
in the South of England and other warm districts.
It finds support for itself by a twist of
its leaf-stalk (you will have watched your Giant
Nasturtiums do this most cleverly), and its colour
varies a little according to its place in sun or
partial shade. The shoots of this creeper must
be cut back in spring, when frosts are well over,
and in hot weather it must be watered.</p>

<p>The Wistaria is one of the most beautiful of
all creepers, and its long mauve racemes mix
well with a Dorothy Perkins Rose. The Wistaria
is a native of China, and was brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Europe by Mr. Wistar in 1816. The original
plant is still to be seen at Wistar House, grown
to an immense size. It is a most useful creeper,
for it will flower year after year without any
attention to roots or soil. If you have one you
should, if possible, get a gardener to pay its
woody branches a little attention once a year,
as, if left quite to themselves, they grow into an
inextricable tangle, too thick in some places, and
not thick enough in others.</p>

<p>We are sure you gardening children who live
in a cold climate must often wish for a warm
one. But now we will tell you about one of the
most brilliant creepers known that likes to be as
far north as possible, spreads like a weed in Scotland,
Yorkshire, Westmorland, and is usually a
‘miffy doer’ in the West Country. This is
the Flame Flower, the Tropæolum Speciosum,
whose vermilion trumpets can be seen two miles
away on a clear day. It is a capricious plant,
sometimes failing when it has every attention,
and succeeding when it is badly treated. Mr. J.
Weathers tells a story of a garden in which it
was planted most carefully in many places, but
some tubers left over were thrust anyhow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
amongst the roots of an old yew. None of the
correctly-planted ones came up, and the others
were forgotten. In the third year someone
noticed a flame-coloured flower on a Yew, and
found that the badly-planted tubers were all
coming up, increasing, flowering, and likely to
go on for ever. It dislikes scorching heat, and
needs moisture in the air. A west or north
aspect suits it, and bushes or hedges amongst
which it can scramble. We know a Westmorland
garden where it can hardly be kept within
bounds, and there they believe in deep planting.
A daughter of the house got it to succeed against
the wall of a cottage on the place, where it had
never succeeded before. ‘What did you do?’
we asked. ‘I dug till I got to New Zealand,’
she said, ‘and then I planted it.’</p>

<p>If you live in the Midlands or the South, where
this Chilian Tropæolum would probably not do
well, you had better be content with the Ampelopsis
Veitchii, the best of the Virginian creepers.
It is a wonderful sight in Oxford all through
September, and even in London it makes a lovely
blaze of colour on many a dull house and wall.
It is the least troublesome of all creepers, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
attaches itself by little suckers. We once grew
the Ceanothus Veitchii with it, a shrub that is
often trained against walls, and which in spring
becomes a mass of powder-blue flowers. It is
one of the easiest and handsomest doers we
know, but be sure to get the right kind, the
Gloire de Versailles or the Veitchii. There are
a good many kinds of Ceanothus, and some are a
very poor colour.</p>

<p>We have told you already about two of the
Clematis tribe, the white Montana and the
purple Jackmanni. The Montana must not be
pruned until its flowering season is quite over.
If you cut it back while it is making new shoots,
you will injure it. The Jackmanni and its relations
are hybrids, and you must try to get either
a layered plant or one grown from seed, as the
grafted ones are unsatisfactory. The flowers are
produced on this year’s shoots. The plants should
be cut down in winter to twelve inches from the
ground. If you get one of the ‘Patens’ section,
remember when you prune that the flowers are
borne on the old ripened wood. Only dead
wood should be cut away. Lady Londesborough,
Miss Bateman, and Mrs. George Jackman, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
three well-known ones. The Wild Clematis,
Vitalba, or Traveller’s Joy, will grow into a dense
mass if left undisturbed. We know of a cottage
where, with a Japanese Honeysuckle, it forms a
rainproof porch; and even that is nothing to one
at Belvoir Castle, which is twenty feet high and
thirty feet in diameter.</p>

<p>The great advantage of Wichuriana Roses is
that they are evergreen, and it is a good plan to
grow one of them—for instance, the deep red
Hiawatha, with the yellow Jasmine (<i>Jasminum
Nudiflorum</i>), whose flowers come out before its
leaves. If we could only have one creeper out
of all there are, we would have this Jasmine,
which flowers in winter, and is quite hardy. Be
sure not to let anyone prune yours in autumn.
Ignorant gardeners often do this, and cut off all
the shoots that wanted to flower. Any pruning
necessary should be done in March or April, but
you need only cut out dead wood. The charming
sprays, if cut in bud, come out well in water.</p>

<p>The Hop is a graceful, hardy, and quick-growing
climber, and there is a variegated kind
that some people prefer. A Hop will cover
a big arch in one year. Also, if you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
not on the spot to attend to it, it will throttle
every other plant near, and it will probably
acquire several varieties of insect blight, and
hand them on to its neighbours. One of the
authors has suffered from sharing a garden with
a Hop enthusiast, and she well remembers the
struggle she had to rescue her Roses, Hollyhocks,
and Delphiniums from the Hop’s embraces
and from the green fly it encouraged. It came
up year after year, too, and would not be killed.</p>

<p>The Everlasting Peas are most useful climbers
in town gardens. They have no scent, but they
give you colour, and are extremely hardy. Then,
there are many annual climbers, some of which
we have told you about already. If you get
Convolvulus Major do not be in a hurry to sow
your seeds. The seedlings are delicate, and do
not seem to recover well if touched by a spring
frost. The first week in May is soon enough.
We have seen their blue trumpets grown with
a Gloire de Dijon, and their pink ones opening
all over an old Lavender bush. Another combination
we remember in the same garden was a
yellow Banksia Rose and a pink monthly one
climbing together up an old grey stone wall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
The climbing La France, too, loves a wall, and
will flower in masses against one.</p>

<p>But we might go on for ever about the fascinations
of creepers and crawlers. The real difficulty
is invariably that of choice. You never
have room for all you want to grow.</p>

<p>So you must decide for yourself what you will
grow; but we advise you strongly to buy your
climbers from a first-rate grower. They only
cost 1s. or 1s. 6d. each; you cannot have room
for many, and they last for years. The cheap
stuff advertised is usually most disappointing.
We once planted two of the Ampelopsis Veitchii
against the same wall, one from the great Veitch
himself, and one from a little man round the
corner. The difference was in colour rather
than in growth. Both lived, climbed, and
covered the house, but it was the Veitch plant
that turned glowing red and yellow. The other
remained brownish-green. It was the same with
a Ceanothus. The one from a good firm covered
a side of the house with soft yet vivid blue in
spring. A cheap one flowered, but its flowers
were wishy-washy, a vexation rather than a
pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Before you plant a creeper turn over the soil
well, and if it is poor have some good manure
forked in. We should never dream of planting
a climbing Rose without digging a large hole
and putting in a quantity of manure for its roots
to feed on, not <i>immediately</i>, but later on. There
should be soil on the top of the manure, and in
that your Rose should be planted, as we have
told you, firmly, yet not too deeply, and with
outspread roots. The main stem of your creeper
should be as near its support as possible, and tied
to nails, wires, or trellis, with bast or twine;
but be careful not to bind it tightly, or when it
grows it will be cut through. Many gardeners
use little strips of cloth and nails, but the cloth
shelters insects.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>FRUIT AND VEGETABLES</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">To</span> this hour one of the authors of this book prefers
unripe Greengages to ripe ones, because they
remind her of those that grew against the wall
of her own garden when she was a child, and
which she always ate long before they were ripe.
In her days children did imprudent things of this
kind, but no doubt you modern children know
too much about the laws of hygiene to run such
risks—at least, we hope so, or we might be
blamed for letting you know that anyone could
eat unripe fruit and survive. We are not going
to tell you much about fruit and vegetables,
because a child is not likely to want his little
garden to be a kitchen garden. In case you are
a town child, and have never seen vegetables
growing, we may as well tell you that they take
a great deal of room. We know a boy in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Germany who went to live in a ground-floor flat
that had a tiny garden belonging to it, the kind
of garden in which you can have three rose-bushes
and a border of pinks. He was so fond of
gardening that after school on a winter day he
would amuse himself with a trowel shovelling the
bare soil up and down; but he knew so little
about it that he wrote to his aunt in England,
saying he wished to grow Potatoes, Parsley,
Mint, Honeysuckle, Runner Beans, and Vegetable
Marrows. The aunt had to explain as well as
she could by letter that in a garden of that size
he could only grow about two Potatoes, and that
he had better try a few Tulips and Daffodils
instead. But when spring came she sent him
some Vegetable Marrow seeds, and they were the
source of a great and joyful excitement later
in the year. The boy was away in the country
most of the early summer, and when he got back
to his little garden in August he found a huge
ripe Marrow and smaller ones coming on. We
can’t advise you to grow Vegetable Marrows,
however, as they take a great deal of room, and
require a mound or ridge. If you have a warm
brick wall you should have a Peach, a Pear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
a Golden Plum, a Greengage, or a White Heart
Cherry. If you have a spare corner, plant a
Gooseberry or a Currant bush. In your border
try to grow a few Lettuces and Radishes, and
some Mustard and Cress for the schoolroom tea.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mustard and Cress.</span></h3>

<p>The author who has survived a yearly crop
of unripe plums has another vivid memory
associated with her schoolroom days in the garden.
She will never forget the moment when she saw
her own initials <i>growing</i> in her own little plot of
ground. There they were, made of Mustard and
Cress, as if someone had written them. It is a
miracle you can perform for yourself any time
from the end of March onwards by drawing the
letters you want in the soil with a stick, and
sowing your seed in them. You must remember,
however, that the Mustard grows quicker than
the Cress, and should be sown about three days
later. Sow both seeds rather thick, and cover
very slightly, or not at all. If it is dry weather
water with a fine rose every evening. People
often place a mat, or even a newspaper, over the
seeds when first sown, as this makes them sprout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
quicker; but the covering must be removed the
moment the seedlings appear. This may happen
in twenty-four hours in favourable weather, so
you must keep a good lookout. In spring and
autumn choose a sunny spot for your Mustard
and Cress, but in full summer give a moist and
shaded position. Mustard and Cress must be cut
the moment it is ready, while the seed leaves are
tender, green, and short. If you leave it till it is
more than about an inch high, the Mustard is too
hot and the Cress is coarse.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lettuce.</span></h3>

<p>Both the Cabbage and the Cos, or Long
Lettuce, can be sown out of doors in little
patches from March to August. First rake the
soil very smooth and fine, and then, if you wish
to have a big bed of Lettuces, draw lines an inch
deep and a yard long, about ten inches apart.
Sow your seed in these little ruts and rake your
bed smooth, taking care that the seed is only
lightly covered with soil. You will soon see
lines of pale-green seedlings, but you will not have
a single Lettuce if you don’t keep off slugs.
They are so fond of Lettuces that gardeners often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
plant them as traps amongst Dahlias and other
flowers they wish to preserve. The slugs will
desert everything else for Lettuces, and can be
caught in numbers on and around them at night.
So if you have a sluggy garden you must catch
all the slugs you can, and also dust your seedlings
with soot or wood-ash. The proper time to do
this is after sunset, when the leaves are a little
damp with dew. When the Lettuces begin to
grow up, the slugs will leave them alone, and then
the rain will wash away the slight dust of ash or
soot from the outside leaves.</p>

<p>When you have rescued your Lettuces from
slugs, you must thin them severely. This is most
important. You wait to do this until they are big
enough to handle easily, and then you leave nine
inches between each Lettuce and its neighbour
in your rows. The French use the small, thinned-out
Lettuces as salad mixed with Cress; and if they
were washed they would be nice with bread and
butter for tea—at least, they would if you had not
been obliged to dust them with soot or wood-ashes.
Cabbage Lettuces do not require tying,
and are ready to cut when they have a firm heart
of folded, crinkled leaves like little Cabbages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Some kinds of Cos Lettuce require tying, but
not all. Sutton’s Superb White Cos does just as
well, or better, without this extra trouble. But
we think some of the good self-folding cabbage
kinds are more suitable in a small garden.
Mammoth White, Nonsuch, and All the Year
Round are good kinds. Lettuces are more
tender when they are grown quickly. It is best
to sow a few at a time about once a fortnight all
the summer, because they must be eaten when
they are ready. If they are allowed to stand,
they <i>bolt</i>—that is to say, they shoot up tall and
begin to grow flowers. Then their leaves become
tough and bitter, and they are spoiled for salad.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Radishes.</span></h3>

<p>In London the Radishes you buy are often
big and coarse. You must try to grow them as
the French eat them—crisp, small, clean, and
pungent, but not acrid. There are several kinds,
as you probably know—some red, some white,
some round like Turnips, and some long like
little Carrots. The long ones, if you fancy them,
should be sown in spring, and the round and oval
ones in hot weather. It is of no use to try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
grow Radishes in rough, lumpy ground. Your
soil must be finely broken and raked before you
sow your seed. If you live in a warm district
you can make your first out-of-door sowing in
February, but this would be too early in cold
climates. Radishes must grow quickly and be
eaten while they are young, or they are not
worth having. On this account you should sow
a tiny pinch of seed every fortnight, rather than
a whole packet at once. They must be well
thinned, as crowded plants make big leaves and
poor Radishes. In early spring give them a sunny
place, but when the warm weather comes sow in
partial shade.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spring Onions.</span></h3>

<p>You will not want to grow big Onions, but
some of the friends you invite to eat your salads
may like some very little ones with Lettuces.
The soil for Onion seed must be rolled or stamped
quite hard and smooth. They never do any
good in loose ground. You sow in March or
April in shallow drills about six inches apart.
When you have sown rake the ground lightly,
and pat it smooth with a spade. As you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
only want quite small young Onions you need
not thin them, but pull one or two when you
want them for a salad. They will not be ready,
however, for your early crops of Cress and
Lettuce, as they grow slowly. Chives are more
delicate than Onions, and are a great deal used
abroad for omelets and salads. You need only
get a clump of these, and if you want to increase
it lift, divide, and replant in autumn or spring.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mint.</span></h3>

<p>Children who live where there is a kitchen
garden will not want to grow Mint, but we
have known of children who were anxious to
have a plant or two of this useful and fragrant
herb. Those who do must be warned that it is
an underground wanderer, and will come up
where it is not welcome if not kept within
bounds. The plants, if they are not to spread,
should be taken up, divided, and replanted in
fresh soil when they show in early spring. It does
best in a moist situation. Each bit must have
a good root, and should be set six to nine inches
from the next. The tops, three to six inches long,
will root easily in summer if inserted about half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
their length, with the lower leaves stripped off,
in a cool border. In dry weather these cuttings
must be watered after sunset. If you are a
London child, and do not know where to get
Mint plants, you could try to raise some yourself
in this way, as Mint without roots is to be
bought everywhere. You would, of course, have
to buy it as fresh as possible.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Parsley.</span></h3>

<p>Parsley seed takes some weeks to germinate, so
you must not be impatient about it. Soon after
its seed leaves appear, if you look closely you
will see the pretty Parsley leaves coming. You
should sow the seed thinly, and then thin again,
first to three inches and then to six inches apart.
All weeds must be kept down, as each Parsley
plant should be big and healthy. When you
gather do not strip a plant, but take a leaf here and
there. When Parsley gets old and coarse the
plants should be cut over, as then they will make
new growth. Those that run to seed must be
pulled up and thrown away. Your bed should
give you Parsley all through the winter and
spring—in fact, until your new plants are ready.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
One annual sowing in April is enough for a
small supply.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fruit.</span></h3>

<p>We know of a lady living in a cathedral town
in the South of England who has three Peach-trees
(two Alexandra Noblesse and one Sea-Eagle),
from which she gets more fruit than
many of her neighbours who own big gardens.
Even in the suburbs of London fruit ripens well,
provided it is grown properly. The best Walnuts
we ever ate were grown in a Surbiton garden.
In the midst of a grimy city we advise you not
to try fruit, as we know of no kind that would
be healthy; but if you are in a country town
or suburb or in the country itself, if you have a
brick wall with a south aspect, and if you live in
the Midlands or in some other warm corner of
England, you should certainly have a tree of
your favourite fruit. It is most important to get
it from a first-rate grower, to prepare the ground
properly, and to plant it well. November is the
proper month for planting. You must get someone
to dig a large hole at least two feet deep, and
put in plenty of manure for the roots to find when
they grow down. If your tree is to be against a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
wall, put the main stem up against it before you
begin, and then spread out the roots carefully in
the shape of a fan. Any that are growing straight
down must be cut off. Those that remain will
be on different levels, so you must arrange the
lower ones first, and put soil amongst them, then
the next, and so on, till they are all comfortably
spread out and covered. The hole in which you
plant a tree should be rather bigger than its roots
when spread out, and about a foot deep. When
finished, the uppermost roots should be four inches
below the soil. If you are going to grow it as a
tree, and not against a wall, you must tie it to a
strong stake directly it is planted. In this case
you must take care that the rope you use does
not chafe the bark. A short length of old hose-pipe
or a band of hay is usually put between
the rope and the tree where they touch each
other. If the tree is to be trained against a
wall, you must first cut off all damaged or broken
branches, and then spread out those that remain
in the shape of a fan. For this purpose you will
want some little bits of cloth, a hammer and
nails. Before you do it you should look at some
well-trained fruit-trees carefully, and try to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
out how they are done. But if you can possibly
get a skilful gardener to plant your tree for you,
we strongly advise you to do so, as a newly-planted
fruit-tree should be cut back more or
less, according to its variety and vigour. Pruning
is also an operation that requires more skill and
knowledge than any child can be expected to
acquire. It should be done for you by the
grown-up gardener. For a year or two a young
tree will not require much pruning, and will not
bear much fruit. If much fruit sets it should be
picked off at once, or it will weaken the tree.
All shoots from the roots should be cut off at
once with a sharp knife.</p>

<p>If your wall is covered with climbing flowers,
so that you have no room against it for a Peach,
a Pear, a Plum, or a Cherry, you might find
a corner for a Gooseberry bush, or a Red or
White Currant. In the North of England you
must put your Gooseberry or your Currant in the
sunniest corner you can find, or the fruit will not
ripen. In the South a little shade and moisture
will suit it better. Gooseberries and Currants
will prosper in any ordinary good garden soil, but
the places for them should be well dug and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
dressed with manure some time before planting.
They must not be put in too deeply, or the roots
will send up suckers. October is a good month
to plant.</p>

<img src="images/i_226.jpg" width="600" height="460" alt="girl with wheelbarrow below blooming window box and another girl in the window" />
<div class="caption">A WINDOW GARDEN.</div>
</div>
<p>Red Champagne, Yellow Champagne, Red
Warrington, and Early Sulphur, are good Gooseberries;
Raby Castle and Comet are good Red
Currants; White Dutch is the best White
Currant.</p>

<p>Gooseberries and Currants are liable to be
attacked by caterpillars in May, and these will
eat all the leaves and destroy your crops if not
removed. Hand-picking is the best way. You
can also first syringe with soft water in which you
have put a little soap, and then dust with a
mixture of dry soot and lime. This will look
ugly for a time, but rain soon washes it away.</p>

<p>Both Gooseberries and Currants require careful
pruning in the autumn. The main branches
should be shortened to six inches, and the side
shoots to two or three buds. You always cut
just above a bud, upwards and slantwise. You
begin on the opposite side from the bud, and end
cleanly just above it. Always choose a bud that
means to grow out from the tree, and not inwards.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>WINDOW, ROOM, AND JAPANESE GARDENS</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">If</span> you are fond of flowers, and cannot have
even a small garden, perhaps you can have a
window-box, or some plants in pots or bulbs in
glasses. A window garden should face south,
east, or west, so that it gets plenty of sun. If
you are obliged to have a north window you
must grow plants that do not need much sun,
such as Creeping Jenny, Musk, Golden Privet,
Euonymus, Crocuses, Snowdrops, and hardy
Ferns. Have your window-box made as long and
as wide as the window-ledge will allow, and see
that there are several holes bored in the bottom
to allow waste water to run away. There must
then be a layer of broken pots for drainage.
The earth with which you now fill the box must
be the very best you can obtain—if possible, a
mixture of good loam, leaf-mould, and sand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
In front you should put plants that will hang
down, such as Petunias, Nasturtiums, Convolvulus,
Carnations, Canariensis, Musk, or the
Ivy-leaved Geraniums. The Giant Nasturtium
and Convolvulus and Canariensis can all be
grown from seed sown early in May, and they
can either hang or climb upwards round strings
or wires put for them from an upper window to
your box. You must, of course, study the colours
of the plants you grow in this way, and not choose
Petunias and Nasturtiums in one season. Alternate
pink Petunias and pink Ivy-leaved Geraniums
would look well hanging down. Behind them you
could have a row of pink Geraniums standing
up, and behind these a row of white Marguerite
Daisies. Another pretty combination would be
Creeping Jenny to hang down, then Heliotrope,
and then yellow Marguerite Daisy. In London
the Heliotrope might be a little uncertain, as it
likes pure air, but Calceolarias should thrive if
properly treated, or mauve Violas. A box filled
with healthy plants in the first week of May
should flower till late in September.</p>

<p>You must never let your window-box get
quite dry, and never water your plants when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the sun is on them. Give a good soak (not a
sprinkle) every evening after sunset. All faded
flowers and dead leaves should be carefully cut
off, and a little Clay’s Fertilizer—a teaspoonful
to half a gallon of water—given once a fortnight.</p>

<p>In the autumn, when your summer flowers
are over, remove them, roots and all, and turn
over the soil well with a hand-fork. If you can
add some fresh soil, so much the better. Then
fill your box with bulbs for the spring. You
might put Snowdrops, or Crocuses, or Siberian
Squills in front, and then Daffodils of medium
height, such as Princess Victoria, Sir Watkin,
or Golden Spur. The back of the box can
either be filled with small evergreen shrubs or
with late Daffodils, such as Emperor or Empress,
or with Hyacinths and Tulips. A box filled
entirely with Tulips will make a splendid show
for three weeks. When a hard frost comes,
or rather a little while before it comes, you
should protect your bulbs with a covering of
cocoanut fibre.</p>

<p>For many years of her life one of the authors
of this book was obliged to live mostly in
London without a square yard of garden, but so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
great was her love of flowers and her desire to
grow them that by degrees she made a ‘room
garden’ for herself, and found endless interest
and pleasure in it. She was prepared from the
first to spend some time each day in feeding,
washing, watering, and shifting her plants; otherwise
success would have been impossible. Unfortunately,
most of us know how miserable
neglected or misunderstood plants soon get to
look in a room—their leaves yellow and dusty,
their flowers stunted, their soil either baked hard
for want of water or sour and mossy through
having more than they can digest.</p>

<p>We fear that if you are unlucky enough to
have gas in your room you cannot have healthy
plants at all—at any rate, you would have to
content yourself with one or two that you could
carry out of your gas-poisoned air every evening.
But if you have no gas, and a sunny window
in which you can place a good-sized plain wooden
table, you may have a delightful room garden, as
well as some pot plants in other places. To
begin with, you would want some of the well-known
hardy foliage plants that you can get
from any good nurseryman. One of the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
known is the Aspidistra, or Parlour Palm. You
can get it with plain green or with variegated
leaves. If it is in good health it sends up new
leaves every spring, and makes queer dwarf
flowers. When it seems too crowded for its
pot you can either give it a bigger one, with
some fresh soil, or divide it. This should be
done in April or May. Young gardeners often
make the mistake of giving a plant too big a pot
when they change it. They hope in this way to
persuade their plant to grow to a great size, but
what they really do is to give its roots more soil
than they can keep healthy, so it languishes or
dies. One, or at most two, sizes larger than the
last pot should be used, or, in the case of Aspidistras,
you can divide and repot into the same
size, or even smaller ones. Some people say
these plants are impatient of disturbance, but we
have found them easy to manage with a little
care. Never use pots that are not both <i>dry</i>
and <i>clean</i>. If they are dirty they must be well
scrubbed with soap and hot water, and then
well dried before you use them. You must also
get a little good soil from a nursery gardener
before you divide or repot any of your plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides Aspidistras, you can have some of the
hardy Ferns, of which the Holly Fern is the
most enduring; Aralias, which look like little
Fig-trees; Indiarubber plants, whose young unfolding
leaves it is such a pleasure to watch;
various hardy Palms (Phœnix and Kentia, for
instance); and some of the hardy Cactuses. The
Indiarubber (<i>Ficus Indica</i>) and Palms are
plants that you must be careful not to overpot.
We know that from sad personal experience,
as well as from some of the great authorities.
In our early gardening days we often used to get
a healthy Palm or Indiarubber from a good
nursery, thinking when we bought it that the
nurseryman was rather stupid and neglectful to
leave the poor thing caged in that little pot of
hard soil. We would bring it home, turn it out,
find its roots in a thick mat, plunge them into a
pot about four times the size of the old one, full
of nice, loose, fresh soil, and expect it to grow like
Jack’s Beanstalk in its happy new conditions.
The ungrateful thing usually died. So remember
that if you repot Indiarubber plants and
Palms at all, take a pot only slightly larger than
the last. Remember, too, that if you overwater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
an Indiarubber plant its leaves will turn
yellow and drop off, while Palms must not be
allowed to suffer from drought. It is death to
nearly all plants to be allowed to stand in stagnant
water. We mean that you must not leave
the water in the saucer that has run out of the
pot. When a plant is dry it is a good plan to
plunge it in water nearly, but not quite, up to
the brim of the pot, and to leave it there till the
top of the soil is moist. That will show you
that it has had enough to drink, and it should
then be lifted out and allowed to drain before
being replaced in its saucer. If you let plants
stand in stagnant water day after day, they soak
up more than they can digest—their leaves turn
yellow, their roots rot, and they die. You can
generally judge by the state of the pot whether
you should give water. At least we know one
good amateur gardener who would never water a
plant in a moist pot, but only one in a pot that
felt dry to the touch.</p>

<p>All foliage plants must be sponged once a
week with a soft sponge and lukewarm water, as
dust chokes and kills them. If you can put
them out on some leads after sponging and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
spray them well with a syringe, so much the
better, but this must be only done in mild
weather. Remember, too, not to use ice-cold,
hard water from a tap. In summer let them
stand out in soft warm rain as often and as
much as possible.</p>

<p>Many plants in pots die of starvation. When
you drench them with water, the water that runs
off carries plant food with it, and this is often
not replaced. We used to use a little Clay’s
Fertilizer, about half a small teaspoonful to a
half-gallon of water, well mixed; but lately we
have used Shefa, a new kind that is especially
suitable for ferns. These liquid manures must
never be given more than once a month, and
never to flowering bulbs.</p>

<p>If you have more plants than will stand on
your table in the window, you must shift some
of them every week, and bring those that have
had several days of semi-darkness to the light.
You must also be careful not to let your plants
stand in a draught. It is most injurious to
them, especially when it is a cold one. If you
have a light bathroom, with a good-sized window,
and are allowed to use it, you would find it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
help, as the air of a bathroom is sometimes
steamy, and never as dry as that of a sitting-room.
You could put plants that you wanted
to nurse there, and more especially a succession
of bulbs when they have made their roots in
darkness and first need the light.</p>

<p>The real joy and glory of room gardens are
the flowering bulbs, and the more you can have
the better; but grow a few of many kinds
rather than many of a few kinds, because then
you will have a longer and more continuous
succession. You do not want your room over-crowded
at one time, and then empty of scent
and colour. In September you should muster
your glasses, bowls, and pots, and decide what
you want and can afford to buy, and you must
also choose what you will grow your bulbs in.
Hyacinths, as you no doubt know, do well in
water, and nowadays you can buy pretty squat
glasses instead of the ugly tall ones we used to
have. The bulb should almost, but not quite,
touch the water; if it gets sodden, blue mould
forms on it, and it decays. Crocuses are also
grown in water in small glasses sold now for this
purpose. The early Roman Hyacinths and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Polyanthus Narcissus will also flower well in this
way. When you grow bulbs in water you will
find that you must often add a little. The
amount a Hyacinth in flower will drink is surprising.
Many people change all the water in
their bulb glasses once or twice in the season.
A scrap of charcoal in each glass keeps the water
clean and wholesome.</p>

<p>Many mixtures for growing bulbs are recommended.
The one we like best for bowls without
drainage is gravel mixed with a little carbon.
You buy it in little sacks mixed ready for use at
any of the big London shops that have a gardening
department, and probably at any good florist’s
elsewhere. Moss-fibre is satisfactory, too, but
the gravel is cleaner to handle, and the carbon
keeps the water sweet. From the moment that
bulbs are planted in bowls they must not be
allowed to become quite dry. If you think there
is too much water, however, you must put your
hand over the top of the bowl to keep your bulbs
in place, tilt it a little, and drain off the water.
For ordinary flower-pots a mixture of leaf-mould
and sand is good, and while these are in the dark
you must not water much, or the soil will get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
sour and unhealthy. In planting bulbs for a room
garden, do not set them deeply in the gravel or
moss-fibre. The point of the bulb should just show
above ground. This applies also to bulbs grown
in ordinary pots. Whatever medium you use
should be damp when you finish your planting.
Your bulbs must then be put into a dark, cool
place for four weeks to make their roots. An
airy cellar is good, but many people use a cool
cupboard. They usually choose one that is sometimes
opened, and therefore aired for a moment.
At the end of the four weeks the bulbs must be
brought into a light and cool, but not cold, place,
and it was at this stage that we found a bathroom
window so useful. When the green is
well up and the flowers beginning to show, they
may be moved to a light place in your warm
sitting-room.</p>

<p>The first bulbs to push up are the white single
Roman Hyacinths. These, if planted in September,
will bloom in November, and will give
you a little of the promise and fragrance of
spring in the dull, dark days. Two dozen bulbs
would be enough to buy, and of these one dozen
should be started in September and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
dozen in October for succession. Next come
the red and yellow Duc Van Thol Tulips,
Crocuses, Trumpet Daffodils, and Hyacinths.
The two earliest Daffodils are Trumpet-Major
and Sir Henry Irving, and they should be
planted in September. The Hyacinths look
well either singly in glasses or three together in
a bowl. In October plant some of the later
Daffodils—for instance, Golden Spur, Princess
Victoria, Emperor, and Empress. These may
all be treated in the same way: set in gravel
with a little carbon added, kept from frost
and in the dark for four or five weeks, then
brought to a cool, light place, and, when
in bud, to the warm room. The Japanese
Sacred Lily, which is so largely advertised, is
only a large kind of Polyanthus Narcissus. It
is easy to grow in a sunny window; but we
should always buy Narcissus Gloriosa instead,
as it is very like it, just as sweet, and about a
quarter the price. All these Polyanthus Narcissi
bloom well in pots without drainage, and if you
have a blue-and-white bowl you should fill it
with the one called Soleil d’Or. Scilly White,
too, is easy to grow in a room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>So far our description of the room garden
has dealt with foliage plants and spring flowers,
but there are also many summer flowers that do
well in a light window. In most parts of England
the cottage windows show you that. For
instance, you often see the blue or white hanging
Campanula Isophylla, such a mass of flower that
it covers the pot. It is an easy plant to manage
and propagate. If you get a healthy specimen
of it in May, it should flower all the summer.
In the autumn cut it back a little and give a mild
dose of liquid manure. It will flower for years
without being repotted, and can be increased by
cuttings put round the edge of a pot and stood
in a window. Gardeners always put anything
they want to strike near the edge, and not in the
middle of a pot. Begonias make handsome room
plants; so do Fuchsias, Heliotropes, and Geraniums.
We have seen a big plant of Heliotrope
that had lived for years in a Paris window, but it
does not like the sooty air of our big cities.
Some of the vigorous Ivies grow well in pots, and
in Germany you often see them trained round
picture-frames. We once brought a spray from
the country that was so determined to grow that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
it rooted itself in an earthenware jug, lived for
more than two years on an occasional drink of
fresh water, and only died when we were away
from home and could not attend to it. Geraniums
would rather be dry than wet. The pretty
white Spiræa and the little trailing yellow Musk
are both very thirsty plants, and flag at once if
you neglect them. The Vallota Purpurea, the
Scarborough Lily, is a splendid window plant.
When once you have potted it you should not
disturb it, as it flowers best when it is almost
bursting the pot with its big onion-shaped bulbs.
The Vallota never cares to be wet, and after it
has flowered it needs very little water; yet it
must not become bone-dry. You will say these
are difficult directions, and we can only agree
with you. Gardening is an art that in the end
must be largely learned by experience, and the
earlier you begin to practise it the sooner you
will find out some of the things all the books in
the world cannot tell you. You cannot give a
recipe for watering as you can give one for a cake
or a pudding, because the same plant will need
different quantities in different conditions and at
different times. When you see leaves flag in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
their flowering season, they probably want water;
when they turn yellow and drop off, they have
probably had too much. In winter you must not
water in a room likely to feel frost at night, as
that would help to freeze the roots. You are
sure to have some failures and some successes
with your plants to the end of your gardening
days, but every failure ought to teach you, and
every success will spur you on. The true gardener
loves his art so well that he will grow what he
can even under difficult conditions.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Three Golden Rules for the Room
Garden.</span></h3>

<p>Keep your plants free from dust on their leaves.</p>

<p>Keep stagnant water out of their saucers. See
that those in undrained bowls are just moist, but
not wet.</p>

<p>Give all the light and air possible, but remember
that draughts are injurious.</p>

<div class="caption">A ROOM GARDEN IN SPRING.</div>
</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Japanese Garden.</span></h3>

<p>This is the story of a Japanese garden made
by one of the authors when she was in her London
home, and had to grow all her plants in a window-box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and in a room. The Japanese, as you probably
know, think that size in a garden does not
matter, provided that everything is in proportion,
and they produce the most wonderful effects of
landscape gardening in a small space. The one
in the room was copied as nearly as possible from
a photograph of a real one. To begin with, a zinc
tray was made, five feet long, two feet wide, and
four inches deep. At one end a hill was arranged
of good-sized stones bedded in earth. Halfway
up the hill grew a dwarf Japanese Fir-tree. It
was really in a pot, but the pot was hidden by
Moss and stones. On the other side of the hill,
a little lower down, there was an Orange-tree,
covered with small red oranges. These are to be
had at any good flower shop for five shillings. The
Orange-tree lasted a year with care, but the Fir-tree
lasted five years in London, and is still alive
in a West Country garden. Down the centre of
the hill a staircase was made of small, flat stones
wedged into the earth, and beside this several
sorts of tiny hardy Ferns grew. At the base of
the hill a good many plants in pots were arranged
to look as natural as possible, but all the pots were
bedded in earth and covered with Moss. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
paths were arranged with flat stones, and one of
them led to the lake. This was made of a green
earthenware dish eighteen inches long and an inch
and a half deep. Ferns hung over its edge, and
one or two hardy water-plants grew on its surface,
while over a corner of it there was a wooden
bridge. At the back of the lake there was a tall
Umbrella Fern that looked like a Bamboo. Stones
were artfully arranged so as to break the straight
lines of the dish, and in the spring bulbs grown
in very small pots were flowering near it. Some
of the miniature Daffodils do well for such a
purpose, and so do Crocuses, Snowdrops, and
Squills. The dwarf Japanese trees you need for
such a garden are rather expensive, but if you do
not mind that you can get many beautiful kinds.
Any of the Japanese curio dealers would sell
little china temples, houses, lanterns, and figures
that add to the quaint charm of a garden made
in this way. If you please, you may call it
artificial, but that is a word you may apply
to any form of gardening. When you have
made your Japanese garden with great skill and
patience, and kept it in good order by unfailing
care and attention, you will be rather vexed if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
other people who cannot keep a Fern alive exclaim:
‘Very curious, certainly, but quite artificial.’
Of course you will smile politely and
say nothing, but in your mind there will be some
lines from Shakespeare’s ‘Winter’s Tale’ which
will comfort and support you. They come in
that scene where Perdita says so many beautiful
things about the flowers in her garden—when she
talks of the Marigold that goes to bed with the
sun and with him rises weeping; and of Daffodils
that come before the swallow dares, and take the
winds of March with beauty. But in her garden
she has no streaked Gillyvors (Stocks), and she
tells Polixenes, the King, that she will not grow
them because they are ‘artificial.’ ‘There is an
art,’ she says, ‘which in their piedness shares
with great creating Nature.’ And Polixenes
answers her:</p>

<p class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">‘Say there be;</span><br />
Yet Nature is made better by no mean,<br />
But Nature makes that mean: so, o’er that art,<br />
Which you say adds to Nature, is an art<br />
That Nature makes.’<br />
</p>

<p>But you mustn’t take this quotation as an
excuse for carpet-bedding.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>CALENDAR OF WORK</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">January.</span></h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Unless</span> you live in a warm corner of these
islands and have a sunny garden, you will not be
able to do much this month. If you have any
empty ground it should be dressed with manure,
dug on a mild day, and left with a rough surface.
The frosts then help to break it up, and when
spring comes it will be powdery and friable.</p>

<p>Fruit-trees should be dusted after a slight rain
with slaked lime or fresh soot, as this kills moss,
lichen, and the insect pests that lodge in the
rough places of the bark.</p>

<p>Iris Stylosa should be flowering now in the
South of England, and even in colder climates
under a south wall. Slugs are fond of these
plants, and eat them up when they are in bud.
If you notice that this is happening, you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
dust with wood-ashes or soot. Gather the flowers
with a sharp upward jerk when in tight bud, and
put them in a room in tepid water to expand.</p>

<p>Snowdrops, Winter Aconites, Crocuses, Squills,
early Daffodils, and Grape Hyacinths will all
begin to push towards the light this month.
When they are growing in heavy soil that cakes
badly, you help them by carefully loosening it
a little with a hand-fork. You must not do this
in frosty weather.</p>

<p>All delicate plants will need protection now.
A piece of rough matting supported by sticks at
the comers is enough for many things. It is not
a bad plan first to stretch a piece of wire-netting
across the sticks and fasten it securely. By day
it lets in light and air, and at night the mat
or sacking is easily thrown over it. If ever you
are on the Riviera you will see the gardeners put
their plants to bed every evening as carefully as
if they were children, while in this country, where
much cold is expected, you see numbers of plants
in any well-tended garden protected the whole
winter with coverings of bracken or matting.
When the plant you want to protect is below
ground (a delicate bulb or tuber, for instance, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
one that quite dies down in winter), you need
only pile on manure or ashes or dead leaves
to act as a blanket. We know someone who
grew tuberoses successfully out of doors in a
Cornish garden, and in the winter he protected
them with little heaps of ashes, which he did
not remove till the May frosts were over. In
most parts of England manure is used as a protection
for Roses and slightly delicate climbers;
but a skilful gardener will shelter many of his
delicate plants with little tents that he makes
of twigs and bracken. We have seen them all
shapes and sizes in a North Country garden where
many rare things are grown. Some enclosed the
plant altogether, and some gave it shelter, but
let in sun and air on the south side.</p>

<p>This is the month when seed lists arrive, and
remind you that spring is coming. Remember
that it is easier to buy seeds than to grow them
well, and do not order more than you have room
for, or any requiring conditions you cannot give
them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">February.</span></h3>

<p>All weeds should be destroyed this month,
both in the path and the edging, as well as in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
border. If you have Dandelions or Hemlock,
cut their heads off, and cover the remains with
common salt. Plantains and most other weeds
may be killed in time in this way.</p>

<p>Perhaps you remember that line in Tennyson
about Geraint glancing at Enid ‘as careful
robins eye the delver’s toil.’ You are sure to think
of it this month when you begin to fork over
your garden, for wherever you turn the soil there
you will see a robin with its red breast and bright
eyes looking for food. Never drive one away,
for they eat wood-lice, grubs, and worms, but do
no harm to plants. A nice big toad—not a frog,
but a rough, grey toad—is a most desirable friend,
too, as he will eat ants, wood-lice, and flies. Ants
are sometimes most mischievous in a garden.
They do not eat plants, but they eat certain
aphides they find on the roots. Anyhow, they
will kill your pet plant if they are so inclined.
You see it turn yellow and die, and when you
take it up you find its roots gnawed away. We
do not pretend that this is a scientific description
of what happens, but only one we can relate out
of our own sad experience. We once built a
wall with great care, meaning to grow many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
beautiful rock plants on it. We could not
understand why they flourished for a time, and
then died. Then we found the ants and tried
to kill them in various horrid ways that made
us feel like inquisitors. We won’t harrow you
with them, because they were not only cruel, but
useless. At last we asked one of the best gardeners
we knew what he did when one of his plants was
attacked by ants, and he said he only knew of one
thing to do, and that was to remove the plant.</p>

<p>Lady-birds, as well as birds and toads, are
friends in your garden, as they eat aphides—what
the little girl in one of Anstey’s stories calls
‘those horrid little green atheists.’ Sparrows
you must keep away this month with black
cotton amongst your Crocuses if you want to see
the flowers whole and upright. When you find
their yellow petals strewn on the ground, you
will know that the mischievous birds have been
at them. In mild springs some of the herbaceous
plants begin to push up young leaves this month.
The Phloxes are amongst the earliest. Look out
for slugs, or they will devour the early shoots
of many plants, often so greedily that the plant
cannot recover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>Japanese Lilies are now arriving, and should
be planted in peat and sand. The sand keeps
off slugs and attracts moisture. They should
have a thick dressing of manure on the top to
keep out frost.</p>

<p>Sweet-peas may be sown this month without
harm, but it is too early for your other seeds, as
long as you depend on an outdoor garden. The
impatient, inexperienced gardener reaps nothing
but failure when he sows too early. If you are
lucky enough to have a frame, you will find it
most useful, even though the elaborate, costly
hot-beds described in gardening books are beyond
your reach. A simple hot-bed can be made with
some manure, which must be put in the frame
and turned over two or three times with a garden
fork. It is then spread out flat, and covered with
good garden soil. You can either sow your seeds
in this soil or put your seed-boxes on it a few
days after it is made. If a hot-bed cannot be
made you can fill your frame with cinders, and
place your seed-boxes on them. The boxes
must be lifted in some way, so as to be near
the glass, or the seedlings would grow spindly.
On warm days you must open your frame and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
let in air, or the soil will turn sour and
mossy. In showery weather let in rain, and in
a drought water judiciously. The four elementary
things to remember about seeds grown
in a frame are: they must be raised in some
way, so as to be near the glass; they must
have air to keep the soil healthy; they must be
shaded from strong sunshine; and they must be
moist, but not too moist. You do not want
them either to be withered by drought or
smothered by moss.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">March.</span></h3>

<p>This is a busy month in the garden. When
it ‘comes in like a lion’ you have to sit idle;
but directly there are mild, dry days you should
be at work. Wherever you mean to sow seeds
the ground should be well dug, and then raked
smooth and fine. If you just rake the top, and
leave the soil beneath in a hard cake, your seeds
will be like those sown in the parable that fell on
stony ground and had no depth of earth. They
will spring up, but they will have no roots, and
when the sun comes they will wither away. In
a cold climate Sweet-peas and Mignonette should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
not be sown till the middle or end of this month,
and most other seeds will do better if sown in
April. March is too early for Nasturtiums or
Convolvuluses, two flowers most children wish to
grow.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the month you can divide
those herbaceous plants that are not spring-flowering,
if you wish to increase them. You
must not disturb plants that are just going to
flower, but all the strong kinds will stand division
and transplanting when they have only sent up
young leaves. For instance, you could take up
a Phlox, a Michaelmas Daisy, or even a Pyrethrum,
on a showery day, pull it to pieces, and find that
every bit made a strong plant by the autumn.
In the rock garden the mossy Saxifrages that
have bald places in the middle should be taken
up, divided, and firmly replanted. This is the
way to treat many little rock plants that grow
themselves shabby in a year or two.</p>

<p>Any new hardy perennials you want may be
planted in favourable March weather, and so may
the autumn-flowering Gladioli.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">April.</span></h3>

<p>Most of the hardy annuals may still be sown
this month. Those sown in March will be coming
up, and you must remember what we told you
about the importance of thinning out. In some
gardens nearly all annuals are raised in boxes,
and pricked out in the borders where they are to
bloom. We tell you this because you may
belong to a garden where you can get all the
annuals you need given this month in the shape
of little ready-made seedlings. You must plant
them several inches apart on a showery day, and
shade them from the sun at first; a tent made
of four sticks and a newspaper will serve when
there is no wind. As soon as they have taken
root, and look well established, it is a good plan
to pinch off their tips with your thumb and
finger, because then they will make spreading
side shoots, and give you more flowers. You
can pinch most of your annual and herbaceous
plants in this way when they are young, but you
must not do it to any plant growing from a bulb
or a corm, such as a Lily or a Gladiolus. Some
tuberous plants, such as Dahlias, may be pinched
with advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Roses are pruned in March or April, but the
different varieties need different treatment. You
must get some good advice about your special
kinds, or be content to cut away the dead-looking
wood. The green fly begins this month,
and you should keep your Roses free from it,
either with an aphis brush or by spraying with
quassia chips and water as recommended on
p. 126.</p>

<p>Weed hard this month, as you do not want
any weeds to seed themselves, and they will do so
if you neglect them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">May.</span></h3>

<p>The leaves of your early-flowering bulbs will
now begin to look shabby, but you must put up
with that if you do not mean to throw away your
bulbs or to lift them carefully to the wild garden.
Daffodil leaves may be tied up with string or
raffia if they are sprawling over seedlings, or over
plants you want seen. Weeds grow fast this
month, and should be diligently removed.
Gardeners weed with a Dutch hoe, but it is an
implement that does more harm than good if
unskilfully used. You will find when you first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
try to use one how easy it is to damage the
young shoots of your treasures with a hoe,
and that in a crowded corner it is far safer to
weed with a knife or a small hand-fork.</p>

<p>The middle or the end of May is an exciting
time in gardens, because we then bring out our
half-hardy plants. Dahlias, delicate annuals, and
bedders are all put into the borders when the
early May frosts are over. If possible, this should
be done in showery weather. Two or three dull,
damp, warm days save a gardener a deal of
trouble in shading and watering at this time
of year. In case the weather is fine and dry,
however, remember that a great deal can be done
by planting each plant in a little puddle of water
and shading it with a flower-pot or a box, or any
little tent you can invent. When the nights are
warm these coverings can be removed at sunset
and replaced in the early morning. You will
have to judge in each case how many days of
such care a plant requires. When its roots are
well established, it will look after itself by day as
well as by night.</p>

<p>You know, of course, that plants must never
be watered when the sun is on them. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
if ever you see a plant flagging badly in the
sun, and plainly dying for a drink, you may give
it one carefully at its roots. Do not let the
water touch its leaves, and, if possible, shade it
for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>A great many biennial and perennial seeds are
sown in May, for a gardener must work for the
years to come as well as for the present one. It
is a good plan to try to grow one biennial and
one perennial every year, as two boxes of seedlings
do not give you too much work. Be sure to get
your seed at one of the best places, for nothing is
more disappointing than to take great pains with
inferior seed.</p>

<p>Look carefully at your Rose-trees every day this
month, and remove any leaves that are curled
and stuck together. Each one contains a grub,
that will become a caterpillar and devour the
foliage of the tree later on. Leaves that are
merely curled by cold, and not stuck together,
must not be picked off.</p>

<p>Convolvulus seed may be sown in the open
this month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">June.</span></h3>

<p>Many plants will now require staking. We
have told you how this should be done at the end
of the chapter on ‘Hardy Perennials.’ Towards
the end of the month you will find the leaves of
Crocuses and Snowdrops quite dead, so that you
can remove them without injuring the bulbs.
At the beginning of the month you can still put
out bedding plants, half-hardy annuals, and
biennials. A plant may be put into the open
ground out of a pot at almost any time of the
year. It is the safest way of transplanting in hot
weather, but you must distinguish between plants
that have been honestly grown in pots and those
that a nurseryman has potted from boxes a day
or two ago. When the soil falls away and leaves
the root and stem quite bare, your plant will
want care and shade as much as if you had just
pulled it out of a box yourself.</p>

<p>Your Primroses and Auriculas should be taken
up and divided this month if you wish to increase
them. Let them spend the summer in a moist,
shady corner of the garden. You will probably
lose them all if you plant them where it is hot
or dry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">July.</span></h3>

<p>During this month and the next, when the
soil is heated by the summer sun, you take
cuttings and pipings, and make layers of the
plants you wish to strike. Pinks are increased
when they have done flowering, but the young
shoots of the Carnation are often layered while
the older shoots are still in flower.</p>

<p>Daffodil leaves should now come away with a
touch, and without injury to the bulbs. Every
day this month you should visit your garden
with a pair of scissors, and cut off all dead flowers
and all annuals that are going to seed. Not one
Sweet-pea must be allowed to make a pod, and
your Mignonette will have a longer flowering
season if you can cut off the green seed-vessels
directly they appear. Perhaps you will like
some of your Love-in-a-mist to form its handsome
seed-pods and sow itself for next year.
One pink Canterbury Bell, too, would give you
seed enough to fill a big garden; but its seedlings
will probably not be pink if you have allowed
blue and white ones to grow near it.</p>

<p>When your Lupins, Pyrethrums, and Delphiniums
go out of flower, you can either cut off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the flowering stems and leave the rest of the
plant, or you can cut down the whole plant close
to the ground. When you cut down severely
you should give a little extra food in the shape
of manure, bone-meal, or Clay’s Fertilizer. We
did not include Pyrethrums in our short list
of perennials, because they are rather capricious:
easily managed in some gardens, and bad-tempered
in others. Slugs devour them. If they are given
to you, and you want to cut them down, do
it rather gingerly, and in damp, dull weather.
We are not speaking by any orthodox tradition,
but out of our own experience, as we have lost
many a fine clump through being told that they
could be cut down sharply after flowering. In
dry weather the operation kills them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">August.</span></h3>

<p>The chief things to do this month are to enjoy
your garden, to cut your flowers, and to keep
things tidy. Pinks, Pansies, and Carnations may
be increased in the ways we have explained. If
you have Rose-trees of your own, or are allowed
to take a few cuttings from other people’s, you
should try to grow some on their own roots.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
We have told you how to take the cutting and
how to plant it in the chapter on ‘Roses.’ The
bulb lists arrive this month, and you must
decide what bulbs you want for autumn planting.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">September.</span></h3>

<p>Your spring-flowering bulbs should be planted
this month. In some cases it cannot be done,
because their places are not vacant yet, or because
you mean to dig over your whole garden later in
the autumn. But where complete reorganization
is unnecessary, try to find room for your bulbs
as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you have any biennial or perennial plants
grown from seed sown in May, they should now
be strong and big enough to transplant to their
flowering quarters. This is an operation you can
carry out either in autumn or spring, but not in
winter. Frost soon kills plants that have not had
time to take a firm hold of the soil.</p>

<p>Autumn brings much labour in the garden in
the shape of tidying, weeding, and preparing for
next year. Annuals that have become shabby
may be pulled up and thrown away. They will
leave a bare place that you must dig over well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Before you replant it you must consider whether
what you are going to plant would like a little
manure beneath its roots, or as a blanket on the
top. A greedy annual has probably impoverished
the soil.</p>

<p>Herbaceous plants that flower in spring may
all be divided and reset now.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">October.</span></h3>

<p>In October great operations are carried out in
herbaceous borders. New plants come in from
nurserymen or friends; old ones are cut down,
fed, and in some cases divided; seedlings are put
in groups where they are to flower. These things
are done all through the autumn, according to
convenience. In a mild district you may go on
till Christmas planting out and reorganizing your
borders. In a cold one get it done at the end of
summer, before the frosts come. Any bulbs you
have not planted in September should go into
the ground now.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">November.</span></h3>

<p>There is still plenty to do in the garden on
a fine day. In a wild garden or shrubbery some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
people leave all the dead leaves lying. We think
that this is advisable in a big country garden, but
not in a small, compact town one, that should
look trim and well-tended. Your flower border
you should keep as neat as your bedroom. All
weeds, dead leaves, and rubbish must be removed
now, and if you have plants that need protection
you will give them tidy heaps of manure, ashes,
or dead leaves. See that the labels and sticks
marking plants and bulbs are firmly in the
ground. Cut down herbaceous plants that have
done flowering. Throw away the annuals that
have become shabby. Lift your Dahlias on a
dry day, cut their stems to within three inches of
the crown of the roots, and put them, stem downwards,
in an airy place to dry. During the winter
they must be kept from frost, but not altogether
from air. They are often stored in a shed, or on
the floor of a cool greenhouse.</p>

<p>Remember that this is the chief month in the
year for planting Roses, and do it at the beginning
rather than the end.</p>

<p>Any part of your garden that is empty may be
dug over and manured now. The surface should
then be left in a rough state, so that the winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
frosts can work the soil well, and prepare it to
receive seeds and young plants in the spring.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">December.</span></h3>

<p>November and December are two most important
months in the gardening year. All the
digging and the alterations you have planned
during the summer are taken in hand now. In
a cold climate you would be careful to finish your
planting early in November, but in the South
and West of England you might still be busy
with a new rockery or a new flower border.
Even in the South you must now expect winter
weather, and should complete your preparations
for protecting delicate plants. One of the enchanting
discoveries you make when you become
a gardener is that there is no ‘dead’ season in
these islands. In the milder corners you may
have Roses, Violets, and Primroses all through
the winter, while the early spring bulbs push
their spikes through the soil before you have
gathered your last Chrysanthemum. But even
in a cold climate, when all your plants seem to
be asleep beneath the snow, you can be busy
indoors for your garden. It is a good plan to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
make plenty of large wooden labels, as the little
ones you buy are easily lost. If you have the use
of a shed or an attic, you may wish to repaint your
watering-can and wheelbarrow; and out of doors
you can sort all your stakes, and point those used
for Sweet-peas with a sharp, strong knife.
Besides, you will probably have some bulbs and
foliage plants indoors that require your care.</p>

<p>If you have any Christmas Roses (Hellebores)
in your garden, it is well worth while to make a
roof over them with strong stakes and sacking.
Then the air can get in at the sides, but the roof
prevents the rough winter rains from splashing
their faces with soil. When Christmas is over
you have January, the worst of the winter
months, before you, and after that you will say
to yourself every day that ‘spring is coming.’
Even during a cold February the lengthening
afternoon lights say this to you a little clearer
every week, and during the spell of mild weather
that nearly every February brings you will find
many other promises of spring in your garden.
So the year goes round for us, a tangled tale
of work and pleasure, success and failure, hope
and disappointment. The great gardener must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
be wise and humble, or he would not be great; so
he knows to the end of his days that he has much
to learn. The child who first plants his little plot
should also teach himself this lesson. Then, if he
observes his plants attentively and patiently, he
will in the course of years become a gardener.</p>

<p class='poem'>
‘Who loves a garden<br />
Still his Eden keeps,<br />
Perennial pleasures plants,<br />
And wholesome harvests reaps.’<br />
